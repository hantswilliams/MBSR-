Sub,Line,Speaker,Text,Date,Participant4,1,INT," There are 10 questions, pretty brief and straight-forward just to get your thoughts on the program. So the very first is if you could talk to me about how easy or difficult it was for you to complete the weekly mindfulness sessions.",7/6/11,A4,2,SUB, The conference call?,7/6/11,A4,3,INT, Correct.,7/6/11,A4,4,SUB," Yeah, so that was fairly easy. It was just a matter of making sure I remembered to call in at the right time and I think you all did a great job sending reminder e-mails and reminder text messages.",7/6/11,A4,5,INT," Ok, cool. So like in terms of being able to call in and listen for the full 60 minutes, was that relatively easy or did you feel like that time period was too long or too short to be able to sort of understand what was going on, and to really try and have enough time to grasp the concepts that the instructor was talking about?",7/6/11,A4,6,SUB," I think that an hour was appropriate. It was enough time for the leader to go through the specific concepts and meditation types that we talked about, and also enough time for ó to provide feedback and have discussions about it.",7/6/11,A4,7,INT," Ok, cool. So ó what question was I going to ask? Something you had mentioned. So in terms of calling in then with the telephone, was that relatively easy for you in terms of that being an acceptable form of communication?",7/6/11,A4,8,SUB," Yeah, I think that worked out really well, particularly the conference calls where we were all able to hear each other ó we were all able to have a discussion, have a conversation. The conference call is a good format. I think I like that more so than having to come to a place and be there in person. I was more comfortable in my own space.",7/6/11,A4,9,INT, It definitely sounds like a convenience factor.,7/6/11,A4,10,SUB, Yes. Definitely more convenient. And another alternative.,7/6/11,A4,11,INT," Yeah. I guess that was sort of the hope there, to try and make it as easy as possible. Ok, cool, so ó",7/6/11,A4,12,SUB," Because of the time, I think, doing it later in the evening, would work better because 5",7/6/11,A4,13,INT," Ok, cool. Yeah, we actually had ó I got a similar comment from someone else that was in the class with you that it seems like 5 pm might not have been the most ideal time. Itês sort of rush hour time. Everyone is either leaving work, or trying to go home, or eating dinner. Thereês definitely something going on. So we were able to take that feedback to where our next group and scheduled them at 3 pm instead of 5 pm, sort of taking that into account because sort of figured that out about halfway through, I think, maybe 5 pm wasnêt the best time. But it had to do with the hours available for the instructor and stuff like that. But trying to make that a little bit easier. So, ok, in terms of the overall impact of this mindfulness program, do you feel it had any effects on your perception of chronic pain, or your pain experience?",7/6/11,A4,14,SUB," In terms of the chronic nature of my pain, no, itês still there, itês still pervasive. But Iêve noticed that when I have spikes of pain, when it gets worse, being able to kind of sit down and calm myself and meditate has been helpful. Kind of like really acute episodes.",7/6/11,A4,15,INT," Ok, so less so with the chronic, lingering, nagging sort of type of pain but more so with the acute sort of short bursts of pain episodes. So what would an example be of, say, acute pain that you have experienced where you then perform some sort of meditative practice, or is there any that you might be able to think of that you can provide as an example?",7/6/11,A4,16,SUB," I canêt think of any certain examples during the duration but I have been meditating, for example, is today Friday? Wednesday, I was at work in my office and I had a spike of pain in my right arm, and so I just closed my laptop, got into a meditative posture in my chair, and tried to focus on breathing.",7/6/11,A4,17,INT," Ok, cool. So that was doing the breathing exercise then?",7/6/11,A4,18,SUB," Yes, the breathing exercise. Correct.",7/6/11,A4,19,INT, Ok.,7/6/11,A4,20,SUB," I found that to be the most helpful of the techniques that we learned. There was one, the body scan, wasnêt helpful to me. Itês focusing on the area where the pain is coming from, for me personally, isnêt helpful. It makes it worse. For me to focus on the breath is definitely helpful.",7/6/11,A4,21,INT, Ok.,7/6/11,A4,22,SUB, Just remembering to breathe and all that. Itês helpful.,7/6/11,A4,23,INT," Great, so it sounds like youêve been able to incorporate in at least that one practice into your daily activities or your ... or how you manage pain.",7/6/11,A4,24,SUB," Definitely, definitely, yeah. It even helps with having anxiety. I use meditation for anxiety too. And itês a similar experience where it isnêt as helpful for chronic worry, or chronic anxiety or pain, but for acute episodes or when I felt panicky, meditating in the moment is helpful.",7/6/11,A4,25,INT," Ok. Right. So I think you sort of answered my next question, what did you find most useful about the mindfulness program, and it sounds like the breathing exercises youêve been able to find pretty useful in terms of managing pain. But in terms of the program, what do you think was the least useful skill or part that you were taught?",7/6/11,A4,26,SUB," I donêt recall the name of it but it was positive affirmations, the one where youêre kind of sending positive feelings to yourself. That one wasnêt very helpful for me. And also the body scan. It wasnêt helpful either. But I can see how that would work for other people. Just personally it didnêt.",7/6/11,A4,27,INT," Ok, got it. So itês just like ó I guess it just doesnêt really work with your way of self-management.",7/6/11,A4,28,SUB, Exactly. Exactly. But I do appreciate knowing that technique.,7/6/11,A4,29,INT, What did you think of the eating exercise?,7/6/11,A4,30,SUB," That one was really interesting. Iêm kind of a slow eater so itês something that I kind of do naturally or unconsciously, try to think about the food that Iêm eating, where it comes from, what it feels like, what it tastes like, and just really enjoying the food.",7/6/11,A4,31,INT," Yeah, just kind of taking your time and experiencing all the smells and the textures and all of the sort of movement of the jaw and that sort of stuff?",7/6/11,A4,32,SUB," Right. Right. And normally, before I focused on the taste or maybe think about where it came from, but putting all of those different aspects _ taste, texture, origin, all that into one exercise was interesting. It was fun.",7/6/11,A4,33,INT," Yeah. Yeah. Thatês definitely one of those interesting exercises which makes you think about things that you donêt normally think about, especially things that are very mundane and everyday activities like eating that we donêt typically give a lot of thought to, which is kind of interesting. People either, I feel, really like it or they are just sort of confused by it.",7/6/11,A4,34,SUB, I can see that. Yeah.,7/6/11,A4,35,INT, So next question. Is there any part of the mindfulness program that you would have liked to have more practice with or more emphasis with in the program that you feel you might have benefitted from more practice or more information from?,7/6/11,A4,36,SUB," Visualization, so thinking about different places while youêre meditating. Because one of the things that Iêve learned with pain is that if I can focus on something else or visualize something then that is helpful in reducing my pain. In the past Iêve imagined a black hole and then pushing my pain into that black hole. And sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesnêt. But I think that having some kind of formal instruction in that would be helpful.",7/6/11,A4,37,INT," Ok, so something more with visualization then.",7/6/11,A4,38,SUB, Right. Right.,7/6/11,A4,39,INT, Ok. So thatês something that you would want more of. Is there anything within the program you feel that you would ó that you think might or should be eliminated or less time or emphasis should be placed on?,7/6/11,A4,40,SUB," No, from what I recall, at least one person got something out of all the activities that we did, so I think it was a good balance. ",7/6/11,A4,41,INT, Ok. So itês pretty well-balanced. ,7/6/11,A4,42,SUB, Mm hm. (yes),7/6/11,A4,43,INT," All right. Letês see. Three more questions. So in terms of the practicing of the mindfulness outside of the one hour weekly telephone call, was that difficult to find time to practice the skills that the instructor was teaching in terms of the actual practice, or in trying to find the time or place to practice, and sort of incorporating it into your schedule?",7/6/11,A4,44,SUB," For me, yes. Less so finding a place, but just being deliberate about practicing for 15 minutes a day. Yeah. I didnêt always meditate every day. Yeah, so no. It wasnêt that it was difficult. Itês just that I didnêt always practice outside of it.",7/6/11,A4,45,INT, Ok. It sounds like youêre breaking up a little bit there so I got part of it. So it sounds like it wasnêt too difficult to practice but itês just hard to find the time within the days to practice?,7/6/11,A4,46,SUB, Correct. Yes.,7/6/11,A4,47,INT," Cool. Got it. So letês see. So now that youêve finished with the mindfulness program, I think you already sort of answered this, do you plan on continuing to practice these sort of meditative skills and techniques you were taught? It sounded like you had provided me with an example earlier, you were saying last Friday or whatever, of having an acute pain episode and being able to do the breathing exercise. But Iêll let you answer.",7/6/11,A4,48,SUB," Yes. Definitely something that I want to continue to do. And I think itês very helpful, not just for the pain but also for well-being.",7/6/11,A4,49,INT," Ok, so more like a general quality-of-life.",7/6/11,A4,50,SUB, Exactly.,7/6/11,A4,51,INT, Cool. Letês see. Would you recommend a mindfulness program like this to a friend or to another person with sickle cell?,7/6/11,A4,52,SUB," Yes, definitely I would. It would be helpful for anyone with chronic pain, and just people in general. Meditation is something a lot of people can benefit from.",7/6/11,A4,53,INT," Yeah. I definitely agree with you there. Itês one of those things that I feel like the hardest aspect of practices like these is just getting into the routine of doing it on a daily basis, or setting aside a specific time within your schedule to sort of try to incorporate it in; but then once you do, it becomes a lot easier and you start to see more of the positive benefits. Just like anything else, when you first get started with it, it can be a little bit difficult to get into the groove of things but ó",7/6/11,A4,54,SUB, Exactly. Exactly.,7/6/11,A4,55,INT, Yeah. But ó,7/6/11,A4,56,SUB, I agree that getting into the habit is difficult. Being deliberate about setting aside time to do it.,7/6/11,A4,57,INT, Whatês your normal ó is your job Monday through Friday?,7/6/11,A4,58,SUB," Primarily, yes, but I also work on the weekends. So Iêm in grad school. Iêm not taking classes now but teaching courses.",7/6/11,A4,59,INT," Yeah, because youêre doing your PhD in psych, right?",7/6/11,A4,60,SUB, Yes. Yes.,7/6/11,A4,61,INT, Yeah. ,7/6/11,A4,62,SUB, Teaching and also developing a course.,7/6/11,A4,63,INT, Oh. Cool. What ó which course are you working on?,7/6/11,A4,64,SUB," So itês for my preliminary exams, developing a course on virtual communities, how theyêre constructed, what they look like, how you characterize a virtual community, but also how they can be used as a form of emotional support.",7/6/11,A4,65,INT, Ok.,7/6/11,A4,66,SUB," For a member, but also for people with health conditions, a chronic medical condition.",7/6/11,A4,67,INT," That definitely sounds quite interesting. I was listening ó when I was driving earlier this morning I was listening to a podcast and they were talking about the applications of that game, Minecraft and how thatês being used in a lot of educational settings and stuff now, not only to teach history lessons and things about the government but also incorporating in social skills and how it all sort of blends together. I thought it was really interesting. I wasnêt really aware that programs like Minecraft _ I was aware of it as like a video game but not as an actual virtual world where people are interacting and you can pretty much do whatever you want to do.",7/6/11,A4,68,SUB," Yeah. I never played Minecraft but I think ó I havenêt heard that podcast but Iêve seen a couple of studies that talked about it in terms of social aspects. And also hand-eye coordination and a couple other things. But yeah, yeah, the games are really interesting. They are a form of virtual community.",7/6/11,A4,69,INT," Yeah, so itês going to be interesting to see where all this technology goes, especially with the new DR and youêre incorporating in new things from the virtual and the actual real world, and how all thatês going to be integrated in, and what the effects are, in a sort of way of interacting with other human beings and, I guess non-human beings. Itês going to be quite intriguing. But yeah, so thatês like pretty much it though in terms of the questions. Is there anything else that you want me to know about your overall experience that I might have not touched on?",7/6/11,A4,70,SUB, No.,7/6/11,A4,71,INT," Anything that might have stood out, you know, anything strange.",7/6/11,A4,72,SUB, Oh. The survey. So we did 3-on-1 surveys? Once in the beginning then halfway through and one at the end? So I think ó So ó I wasnêt very good about tracking my meditation with the log but I think it would have been easier if there were a question that asked how many hours did you spend meditating on the last two or three.,7/6/11,A4,73,INT," Ok, got it. So like some sort of digital version of that form that you could just go onto the Web and fill out?",7/6/11,A4,74,SUB, Right. Right. Incorporate it into the survey.,7/6/11,A4,75,INT," Ok, cool. I was thinking about different ways of doing that because I guess youêre sort of like on the computer every single day with e-mail and everything else. Itês not that big of a deal. But for individuals that may not be as computer-savvy or who have less access, you then need to go from going on the computer from once a day, or once every couple of days to every day just to fill out this log. That was my only hesitancy there, but I definitely do want to make that as an option though, because itês a lot easier for me to store, track, and collect the information. Because hard copies of anything is always a big pain in the butt, dealing with the post office and the mail being lost. Like you said that you were just moving so ó there was a paycheck that ó who knows where it is.",7/6/11,A4,76,SUB," Yeah, so that was the only thing I can think of. ",7/6/11,A4,77,INT," Ok, cool.",7/6/11,A4,78,SUB," You could use an app or something, just something to track it daily.",7/6/11,A4,79,INT," Oh yeah. In the ideal situation, yeah, Iêd get a lot of the funding and give everyone _ you know _ iPads or whatever, so youêd have a nice, easy way of filling everything out. That would be the ideal situation, and then you get a free iPad as well.",7/6/11,A4,80,SUB, That would be great.,7/6/11,A4,81,INT, All right. Iêll be sure to take note of that so when Iêm asking for more money I can tell them that people are requesting for iPads so I need an extra couple thousand dollars.,7/6/11,A4,82,SUB, There you go.,7/6/11,A4,83,INT," All right, great. Thanks again for your participation and helping me out with the study. And just shoot me a text, or give me a call, if you havenêt gotten that last paycheck forwarded to you, and if there is any sort of problem there Iêve got your new address now and weêll be able to resend out that last check. So you got the one for $10 and the one for $20, itês just the last one for $30 that you still need then, correct?",7/6/11,A4,84,SUB, Correct. Yes.,7/6/11,A4,85,INT," Ok, cool, so you know, just shoot me a text then within like a week or two if it hasnêt come and then Iêll get the paperwork going on that and then Iêll let you know once Duke sends it out, so we can get that all squared away.",7/6/11,A4,86,SUB," All right, sounds good. Thanks.",7/6/11,A4,87,INT," All right, cool (name redacted). Best of luck with your program also. So youêll be doing ó so youêve already done the prelims then or thatês going to be coming up?",7/6/11,A4,88,SUB, Iêm doing it now so I have until September to finish developing the course.,7/6/11,A4,89,INT, Got it. So you have summer and then ó well I guess summer now is almost gone which is crazy.,7/6/11,A4,90,SUB, I know.,7/6/11,A4,91,INT," I always think Iêm going to get a lot of stuff done over the summer and then itês the end of summer and Iêm left scratching my head, wondering what I was doing.",7/6/11,A4,92,SUB, Exactly.,7/6/11,A4,93,INT," But thatês the way things end up going. But all right, cool, thanks again, and just give me a call if you have any questions. Iêll be more than happy to answer them. Otherwise, Iêll probably see you in clinic. Iêll still be hanging around there next year.",7/6/11,A4,94,SUB, All right. Sounds good.,7/6/11,A4,95,INT," All right (name redacted). Thanks again, and hopefully you have a nice, relaxing weekend.",7/6/11,A4,96,SUB, All right. Iêll try. You too.,7/6/11,A4,97,INT, All right. Thanks. Bye.,7/6/11,A4,98,SUB, Bye.,7/6/11,A7,1,INT, Are you able to hear me fine?,7/20/15,B7,2,SUB, Oh yeah. I hear you perfectly.,7/20/15,B7,3,INT," Ok, great. So itês just a couple of brief sort of questions to get your overall thoughts on the program and your experience from it, so very very basic questions. So thereês like very very brief € should only take about 30-40 seconds for each of them, but the first one is if you can just briefly talk about either how easy or how difficult it was for you to complete the weekly telephone based mindfulness calls.",7/20/15,B7,4,SUB," Oh it was very easy. It wasnêt difficult at all. I liked the fact that you could call in to a number. You could be anywhere you didnêt necessarily be at home. You know, there were days where I didnêt feel good but it didnêt matter because I was in the comfort of my home. I could be laying down, and most of the exercises required that, you know, you were in a relaxed position anyway. So it was very easy to complete.",7/20/15,B7,5,INT," Great. So you mentioned there were a couple different places that you may have called in to. When you called in, were they mostly from your house or were they also from other places?",7/20/15,B7,6,SUB," Well, one time I called in from a hospital, I was getting an ultrasound done and I called in from there. Iêve been in the car and Iêve called in. Iêve been home. So those were the three places.",7/20/15,B7,7,INT, A little bit all over then.,7/20/15,B7,8,SUB, Yes.,7/20/15,B7,9,INT," Great. So the next question then is sort like a two-part question. So what impact, if any, do you feel this mindfulness program had on your perception of pain, and also on your quality of life?",7/20/15,B7,10,SUB," Well, the first part of that question, pain is very, very physical, but if you can get your mind to be able to control certain aspects when youêre in pain, itês not that the pain goes away, itês just that you feel stronger, more relaxed, and you can tolerate the pain better. So Iêve always found that if Iêm feeling stronger mentally, emotionally, I tolerate the pain better. So the classes offered certain specific techniques to help with that. So the quality of life is just better because of that. Because when you € like 95% of my day is € Iêm in pain in some form or fashion. So being able to have tools that will keep my mind strong helps me tolerate and deal with the pain.",7/20/15,B7,11,INT, Great. So it sounds like youêre able to take a couple parts of the program and incorporate them into your daily sort of life?,7/20/15,B7,12,SUB," Oh yeah. Not only that, some of the things I had been doing before I took this class, but a lot of the other things I learned I rolled it in so Iêve like custom-made something for me. Like so many times when Iêm in the car and Iêll do my breathing exercises. Or Iêll scan my body. And you know, those are things that Iêve learned, and Iêm just incorporating them when Iêm sitting in traffic I can remember so many times Iêd be in pain and so frustrated that Iêm sitting in traffic. Now I donêt feel that way anymore as much because Iêm doing my breathing exercises, Iêm scanning my body, Iêm calming myself down. So itês like any everyday thing.",7/20/15,B7,13,INT," Yeah, I was going to say we all have some form of traffic and car-related pain. And then when you have that confounded with other physical pain itês just I can imagine a not very pleasant sort of situation, especially if youêre stuck in traffic trying to go to work or wherever you might be going.",7/20/15,B7,14,SUB, Exactly.,7/20/15,B7,15,INT," It sounds like with the breathing scan € or sorry € with the breathing exercises and the body scan, you found those to be particularly useful. Were there any exercises or parts of the mindfulness class that you didnêt find as useful?",7/20/15,B7,16,SUB," There was the one thing with the eating. The eating exercise. I did not find that to be very useful. I think the point of that exercise was to show us awareness, to pay attention. But I remember trying to do that while I was eating and I was like _Look, I donêt have time.Ó Iêm a 40-year-old. Sometimes I eat when I can, so I just didnêt have the time to sit there and think about what I € savoring the food and all that kind. Yeah. That was the only one thing that I was like _Eh. This didnêt really help me out too much.Ó",7/20/15,B7,17,INT," Yeah. Iêm definitely sometimes the same exact way where when Iêm starting to eat, the last thing Iêm thinking about is all the different tactile sensations and the aroma. Usually when Iêm eating itês because Iêm very very hungry, and Iêm just focused on getting it into my mouth.",7/20/15,B7,18,SUB," Yeah. Exactly. That was the one thing, but all the other exercises were very helpful.",7/20/15,B7,19,INT," Great. So is there any exercise or part of the program that you feel you wanted more of, or more explanation, or more practice?",7/20/15,B7,20,SUB," No. The way the program is set up now is really great. What I would like to see is if there was, you know, like levels. Like this one was Level 1. And Level 2 would be like, for example, you take the breathing exercises and you incorporate that with some type of physical therapy kind of situation, where, you know €",7/20/15,B7,21,INT, Gotcha.,7/20/15,B7,22,SUB," Yeah. You know. It has to be steps. So thatês what I would like. I would like to see the program grow to where you still keep this. Itês like your introduction. Like everybody has to go through it. And then the next level, ok, so those people who are really interested in moving to the next level, you know, it would be where physically youêre also learning how to move your body, and you know, that kind of thing so you can alleviate feeling the pain. So massage therapy along with the breathing, something like € for me, I think that would be the next step that I would love to see the program go toward, because I think that would really help with sickle cell. ",7/20/15,B7,23,INT, Ok. So sort of combining it with something else.,7/20/15,B7,24,SUB," Yeah, like what we learned €",7/20/15,B7,25,INT," So what like would you feel sort of an example or sort of an introductory step to doing what youêre talking about would be placing some of the exercises in context to some of the specific scenarios in which you could find yourself commonly in within, say, the waiting room, or when youêre € or a possible transfusion, pre-operative sort of readiness €",7/20/15,B7,26,SUB," Exactly. Exactly. Like for example you know, maybe the next € I donêt know how it works, but like you said, when youêre getting a transfusion maybe the next study would be going to people who are getting transfusions and doing it right then with them, you know, in that state, right then and there. I donêt know if you € you wouldnêt get the same people, you know, for that period of time consistently because you donêt get a transfusion like every week kind of thing. But you would maybe get a whole lot of people right at that moment in doing it and you could get their feedback that way. Or, you know, like I said, having a class where massage therapy or physical therapy and you incorporate everything that you learned in the conference call, and you incorporate that but on top of something physical.",7/20/15,B7,27,INT," Ok. That makes sense. Yeah, thatês really good feedback. I think it would definitely be interesting to, at least for those who have a base or a foundation of what this program, or what this sort of type of technique is getting at, and then working with those individuals in the beginning to then see how it can be more adequately placed within the proper context to have a greater impact on the specific short-term € yeah",7/20/15,B7,28,SUB, Yeah.,7/20/15,B7,29,INT," Yeah. Got it. Thatês very very helpful. So in terms of the weekly call, so how often did you find yourself practicing and was that relatively easy or difficult to set aside times to practice during the week?",7/20/15,B7,30,SUB," Actually it was easy because once, you know like I said, you start to figure out situation where you could do it _ because a lot of these exercises you could do it and someone doesnêt know youêre doing it. So I was doing my € I was getting an ultrasound and I was on the call, and the guy knew I was on a conference call but he didnêt know what the conference call was about. So you know when youêre waiting in line at the supermarket, in the car, I have a 4-year-old, picking her up from her classes, or whatever the deal might be and then for me, I incorporate it every night where right before I go to bed, Iêm already laying down, and Iêm scanning where Iêm hurting. Because at night you focus more on the pain because you donêt have anything else to do.",7/20/15,B7,31,INT, Yeah.,7/20/15,B7,32,SUB," So that has become a daily for me. Itês just automatic now. And then it calms me down and so I can get some rest. For some people they might incorporate it in the morning. I think there are several people who said they did it in the morning time. The breathing exercises and scanning their body. So it just depends on the person, but I found many ways to just € itês just like a part of my routine. Like in the car, automatically. Any time itês like a long pause or stop, youêre in traffic, construction, Iêm just doing my stuff.",7/20/15,B7,33,INT," Oh, great. It sounds like it was pretty easy then for you to find everyday situation in which you can apply this sort of technique and then €",7/20/15,B7,34,SUB, Yes.,7/20/15,B7,35,INT," Great. So as you go forward then, do you see yourself _ I think you already sort of answered this but Iêll ask it anyway in a more straightforward form _ but it sounds like € do you plan to continue using these mindfulness practices that you learned during the program?",7/20/15,B7,36,SUB, Yes. ,7/20/15,B7,37,INT, It definitely sounds like you are. So would you recommend a program like this that you just participated in to friends or to others with sickle cell?,7/20/15,B7,38,SUB, Yes.,7/20/15,B7,39,INT, And so then just the very last question then. Is there anything else that youêd like me to know about your experience or any thoughts or concerns related to the mindfulness program?,7/20/15,B7,40,SUB," I just think itês a really great program. And I think itês a great starting point, like if you guys could follow the same group of people and keep adding components and different types of studies with the same group of people so you could really see the impact from the beginning to the end to € you know, maybe theyêd do like five different studies. So that way we can have different people € you know theyêre participating for an extended period of time so you can like really get a good picture of, you know, what itês like and what works and what doesnêt work for sickle cell.",7/20/15,B7,41,INT, Mm. Got it. Yeah.,7/20/15,B7,42,SUB," I donêt know how easy that is to do, but you know.",7/20/15,B7,43,INT," Yeah so Iêll definitely let you know if I end up doing any sort of immediate follow-up to the study because it sounds like you are interested in continuing along with this sort of practice and general type of technique, these sorts of behavioral thinking interventions in which you can try to reframe negative thoughts and emotions, or alter them in such a way in which negative experiences arenêt necessarily as bad.",7/20/15,B7,44,SUB," Yes. I think with sickle cell, the primary way to treat it on a daily basis is to give pain meds. And, you know, with that, on daily pain med taking, there are a lot of consequences. And I think that if, you know € itês sad. Most people follow down that road because theyêre never given the opportunity. They donêt know, theyêve never experienced another way to deal with their pain. And then pain med taking every day € because most sickle cell patients have daily pain. So then you complicate the situation by taking pain meds every day and you end up having other issues and other problems. So I really do think if we could get away from that being the only course of treatment on daily would be so beneficial for so many people who have sickle cell with their pain on a daily basis. Take the pain meds as needed for extremely, you know, severe cases where they donêt need hospitalization but they need something to take the edge off. But they wouldnêt have all the other complications that come with medicine every day.",7/20/15,B7,45,INT," Mm. Yeah, with a lot of the pharmacological and a lot of the chronical analgesic and opioids they definitely have a wide range of negative side effects, which makes me think € so within the mindfulness program, do you feel like it negatively affected you in any way or could you foresee it having any sort of negative impacts on you by performing these practices?",7/20/15,B7,46,SUB, No.,7/20/15,B7,47,INT, Ok,7/20/15,B7,48,SUB," No. No, not at all. Theyêre all beneficial.",7/20/15,B7,49,INT," Great. So Iêll stay in contact with you then. Well, not directly but Iêll watch out for you when you come back into clinic for any sort of quarterly check-in. I forget how often you go in to see (name redacted).",7/20/15,B7,50,SUB, Itês every 3 to 4 months for me unless something is going on.,7/20/15,B7,51,INT, Mm. Got it.,7/20/15,B7,52,SUB, My next appointment is in October.,7/20/15,B7,53,INT," Ok. Yeah. So youêre familiar with Dr. (name redacted), correct?",7/20/15,B7,54,SUB, Yes.,7/20/15,B7,55,INT," Ok, yeah. So he is one of the other pediatric sickle cell doctors there and heês actually also really interested in starting up with some more research in this sort of line of work that Iêm currently doing and what weêll be doing is starting another set of studies that looks at these same sort of approaches but sort of modality is going to be a little bit different. I believe instead of group telephone calls it might be video chatting, which creates another interesting dimension to it, but theyêll be going at it through a slightly different approach. So Iêll take notes that youêre sort of interested in continuing on in these sorts of studies, so Iêll take a mental note of that and be sure to let you know once that gets going because right now thatês still in the very preliminary stages. But Iêd just like to than you again for taking the time out of your weeks to help and to call in and Iêm very glad that you were able to get a few things out of it that you were able to incorporate into your daily activities. And the comments that you provided were very very helpful, and theyêre going to be extremely useful going forward and making changes to the study and how things are done within the near future.",7/20/15,B7,56,SUB," Ok, thank you so much for the pleasure.",7/20/15,B7,57,INT," All right (name redacted). It was very nice talking with you. Thank you again for all of your time and effort, and I will keep a lookout for you within the clinic. And if you ever have any questions about anything, whether itês in terms of the mindfulness or any other alternative approaches in the future, you have my e-mail, so just feel free to contact me.",7/20/15,B7,58,SUB, Ok. No problem. Thank you so much.,7/20/15,B7,59,INT," All right (name redacted) thank you so much. Hopefully you have a nice, relaxing, easy weekend.",7/20/15,B7,60,SUB, Thank you. You too.,7/20/15,B7,61,INT, All right. Bye.,7/20/15,B7,62,SUB, All right. Bye.,7/20/15,B39,1,INT, How are you?,8/1/15,C39,2,SUB," Good, how are you?",8/1/15,C39,3,INT," Good, good, yeah. You know, Iêm very happy to hear the good news about your new baby girl. Glad everything worked out well and thank you for sending me the photos. I like the little purple beanie that she had on.",8/1/15,C39,4,SUB," Yes, thank you.",8/1/15,C39,5,INT, So howês everything now then? Have things sort of calmed down a little bit?,8/1/15,C39,6,SUB," Yes, for the most part. Like I was saying, I was getting my dressing changed because I had a C-section and was on the blood thinner, Lovenox?",8/1/15,C39,7,INT, Blood thinner? Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,8,SUB," Yeah. And when they closed me up, I got a hematoma",8/1/15,C39,9,INT, Mm. So thatês not very good. Is it a small one or a big one?,8/1/15,C39,10,SUB," No, it was big. It was all the way across the incision, and the night we were discharged it opened.",8/1/15,C39,11,INT, Ugh.,8/1/15,C39,12,SUB, And so they decided to leave my wound open instead of stitching it closed again.,8/1/15,C39,13,INT, Just so it drains out?,8/1/15,C39,14,SUB," Yeah. So I have the wound (closure device) back on. But it takes all the moisture out, and it will close the incision from the inside out.",8/1/15,C39,15,INT," Yeah, those are interesting little devices that just work with gravity and negative pressure so you donêt really need to do anything to it. You just let it sit there and it does its job. Iêm glad that they were able to get that all fixed up and luckily nothing happened or anything. It sounds like they were able to get things under control relatively quickly.",8/1/15,C39,16,SUB, Yeah. They were.,8/1/15,C39,17,INT," You know, congratulations again on your child. Very, very beautiful. So then just then just sort of wanted to thank you again for your participation within the mindfulness classes. Hopefully you were able to get a few new things out of them. Iêm sure it was probably a very different experience than anything youêve previously tried, at least thatês what Iêve been hearing from other people that € a little bit off the beaten path but €",8/1/15,C39,18,SUB," It was very, very helpful though.",8/1/15,C39,19,INT, Mm hm.,8/1/15,C39,20,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,21,INT," Yeah, so thatês pretty much what Iêve been hearing from the other people who have also gone through with that. Itês different but it seems like each person is able to get something out of it that theyêve been able to find useful and implement within their own daily routine, either as a way of managing stress or pain, or something around those lines. So what I wanted to do is I have 10 fairly simple questions just to ask you about your experience in this mindfulness class to help me better understand your perspective on it in terms of what worked and what didnêt work. So thereês no right or wrong answers. Itês just getting your thoughts and perspective on this mindfulness program. So if itês all right with you Iêll walk through the questions _ theyêre all very simple _ just 10 of them, and feel free to give as short of an answer as you want. Or if you want to get more detailed in it, youêre more than welcome to get as detailed as you possibly want to. So does that sound good?",8/1/15,C39,22,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,23,INT," Ok, great. So Iêll just read the questions verbatim. The first one is how easy or difficult it was for you complete the weekly mindfulness classes, either in terms of calling in and the timing of the mindfulness classes.",8/1/15,C39,24,SUB, Besides the circumstances of being in the hospital for a couple of the classes it was easy. The call was ok for me since I donêt work.,8/1/15,C39,25,INT, Because I think it was maybe during the 2nd session you may have called in € I think it was when you were having a sonogram done. Is that correct?,8/1/15,C39,26,SUB, Um. Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,27,INT," Yeah, I think it was during one of the earlier sessions because I think you had texted me, or I asked you how everything was going and I think you mentioned that you had called in during one of the sessions when you were having a procedure done, which I thought was kind of cool, sort of an example of how if itês done by telephone you donêt need to be physically anywhere in order to participate with this sort of thing.",8/1/15,C39,28,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,29,INT," All right, cool. Yeah. So it sounds like relative easy for you in terms of calling in and stuff like that. So the second question then is sort of a two-part question. What impact, if any, do you feel this mindfulness program had on your perceptions of pain, and your quality of life?",8/1/15,C39,30,SUB," For the quality of life it had a pretty big impact because it was useful for stressful situations. And as far as pain, it helped somewhat because itês also hard to tune out the pain while doing the exercise.",8/1/15,C39,31,INT," So in terms of quality of life, you said it had a larger impact perhaps on that aspect rather than pain. Is there any example that you might be able to provide, or situations, or context of how does your mindfulness program of how youêve been able to use this mindfulness program to improve your quality of life?",8/1/15,C39,32,SUB," I could say when I got frustrated with having to be in and out of the hospital, and being stressed, and I used it in that situation.",8/1/15,C39,33,INT," Ok, sort of like stress related to hospital visits and I guess sort of the larger interactions with healthcare? ",8/1/15,C39,34,SUB, Correct.,8/1/15,C39,35,INT, Ok. Got it. The next question then would be what did you find most useful about this mindfulness program? Is there anything that you found more helpful in comparison €,8/1/15,C39,36,SUB, Like the breathing exercise?,8/1/15,C39,37,INT, Uh huh. Yeah. I was going to ask if there was any specific exercise that you found most effective.,8/1/15,C39,38,SUB, Yeah. Iêd say the breathing exercise.,8/1/15,C39,39,INT," Ok. So with the breathing exercise, is that the one that you sort of like to do the most?",8/1/15,C39,40,SUB," Yes, that one, and like where youêre lying down and youêre thinking of a happy place and the way you meditate and the sound, the smell, how you feel.",8/1/15,C39,41,INT, So sort of like the body scan exercise?,8/1/15,C39,42,SUB," Yeah, the body scan. Yeah.",8/1/15,C39,43,INT, Got it. Cool. So the breathing exercise and the body scan. So those are two exercises from the program that you found most helpful. Are there any aspects of the class that you didnêt find useful? Or is there anything that you feel might have been over-emphasized that didnêt need as much instruction?,8/1/15,C39,44,SUB, No.,8/1/15,C39,45,INT," Ok. So everything was fairly well-balanced in your opinion, in terms of the practices and exercises?",8/1/15,C39,46,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,47,INT," Ok, great. Letês see. My computer just decided to shut off there. And thatês where I have the questions. I do not have these things memorized. Ok. It looks like it turned back on. Ok, great. So next question is is there any part of the program that you would have wanted more of? Is there any one type of practice or topic that was brought up in one of the mindfulness classes that you feel should have had more emphasis?",8/1/15,C39,48,SUB, I donêt think so.,8/1/15,C39,49,INT, Ok. And I think you already sort of answered this next question is what would you eliminate or have less of in the mindfulness class?,8/1/15,C39,50,SUB, I wouldnêt eliminate anything.,8/1/15,C39,51,INT," All right, perfect. So just three more questions. I know that some of the participants within this class I wasnêt able to provide with audio recordings. Did you get any of the MP3 files, because I think I had sent to you but Iêm not 100% sure. At the beginning of the class, there were some different practice audio tapes, or audio recordings. Did you ever get those?",8/1/15,C39,52,SUB, Iêm not sure. Iêd have to check again. I know I got one.,8/1/15,C39,53,INT," Ok. All right. In terms of practice, did you find yourself being able to practice during the week or did you not have time to practice, or how much emphasis was there on practice for yourself in participating in this class?",8/1/15,C39,54,SUB," I was able to practice because I, of course, used some of the techniques. Itês just a matter of remembering.",8/1/15,C39,55,INT," Mm hm. So when you were practicing on your own, you were just sort of going off of the exercises that were taught during the class, and just trying to replicate those?",8/1/15,C39,56,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,57,INT, Ok. Got it. Was there any type of € earlier you had mentioned that the two practices or exercises that you found most helpful were the breathing exercise and the body scan exercise. So you obviously practiced those. Do you feel like you practiced those exercises more than the other exercises just because those were easy or did you practice everything equally or try everything?,8/1/15,C39,58,SUB, I tried everything but those were the two that I found most helpful for me.,8/1/15,C39,59,INT, Got it. So those were the two that clicked for you.,8/1/15,C39,60,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,61,INT," Ok. Great. So now that the class is over, do you intend on continuing using the mindfulness techniques?",8/1/15,C39,62,SUB, I do.,8/1/15,C39,63,INT," All right, great. Very last question then, would you recommend a class like this, this mindfulness class, to friends or other patients with sickle cell who also experience pain?",8/1/15,C39,64,SUB," I would, and not just patients just friends who are going through things, stress. I would share the techniques with them.",8/1/15,C39,65,INT," All right, great. So thatês pretty much all of the questions that I had for you in terms of your thoughts and perspectives on the mindfulness class, and then what Iêll do if youêre still looking to keep on practicing or trying to practice the breathing techniques and stuff like that, Iêll send you an e-mail that just has the audio recordings. Just in case you never got those previously, and you still want to listen to have some sort of guide to help you practice in the future, youêll have those for future reference. But other than that though, is there anything else that youêd like to tell me about your participation in this mindfulness class that I might have not talked about in terms of any other thoughts or feelings about it? ",8/1/15,C39,66,SUB," No, I donêt think so.",8/1/15,C39,67,INT," All right, so thatês pretty much it then. There is just a couple of questions I donêt have information from you, which is just sort of like background demographic information that I can just type in a form now, so Iêll do that on my end. Itês just five or six questions. Should take like 30 seconds. Let me just open that up quick and weêll be all finished. So sex, female; age, how old are you?",8/1/15,C39,68,SUB,27,8/1/15,C39,69,INT," 27. Letês see. Do you know your sickle cell genotype whether itês like SS, SC, beta €",8/1/15,C39,70,SUB, SS,8/1/15,C39,71,INT," SS. Ok. In terms of complications that youêve experienced related to sickle cell, I donêt know how familiar you are with some of the € Iêm sure youêre more familiar than I am, but in terms of like pulmonary hypertension or hip-knee problems, eyesight stuff €",8/1/15,C39,72,SUB," AVN, avascular necrosis of the lips €",8/1/15,C39,73,INT, Have you ever had ,8/1/15,C39,74,SUB, Iêve had two mini-strokes.,8/1/15,C39,75,INT, Ok. Two mini-strokes. Was that as a child then or recently?,8/1/15,C39,76,SUB, As an adult.,8/1/15,C39,77,INT, Ok. And then in terms of experiencing any altered or ocular sight difficulties.,8/1/15,C39,78,SUB, No.,8/1/15,C39,79,INT, Acute chest syndrome?,8/1/15,C39,80,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,81,INT," Ok. So in the last two years, how many emergency department visits related to sickle cell do you think you have probably had?",8/1/15,C39,82,SUB, Past two years? Emergency visits? Maybe eight.,8/1/15,C39,83,INT," Eight, ok. And then out of those eight visits, so sort of a very similar question but slightly different, how many hospitalizations related to sickle cell have you had over the last two years? And this could be counted as, you know, say you were in the emergency department and then from the emergency department you were then transferred to the main hospital as an inpatient.",8/1/15,C39,84,SUB, Iêd say five of those.,8/1/15,C39,85,INT," Ok. Are you being treated for, or have you ever been treated for depression or anxiety?",8/1/15,C39,86,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,87,INT, All right. What is your highest level of education?,8/1/15,C39,88,SUB, Trade school.,8/1/15,C39,89,INT, Ok. Trade school. What was the trade school in?,8/1/15,C39,90,SUB, Phlebotomy.,8/1/15,C39,91,INT," Oh, cool. Thatês definitely different.",8/1/15,C39,92,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,93,INT, Why did you make that choice?,8/1/15,C39,94,SUB," I always found it interesting, ever since I was little when I was going to Duke Pediatrics. There was a phlebotomist that taught me how to draw my own blood.",8/1/15,C39,95,INT," Oh, cool.",8/1/15,C39,96,SUB, She would let me draw my own blood whenever I came but ever since then thatês something I wanted to do.,8/1/15,C39,97,INT," Yeah. I feel that can be extremely stressful job when people have a small, tiny veins.",8/1/15,C39,98,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,99,INT, I feel it can either be really easy or really difficult.,8/1/15,C39,100,SUB," Yeah, and I worked in geriatrics.",8/1/15,C39,101,INT, So itês hard.,8/1/15,C39,102,SUB, So they had old veins.,8/1/15,C39,103,INT," Yeah. Fragile skin and everything, bruise really easily.",8/1/15,C39,104,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,105,INT," All right, so just three more questions. I think youêve already told me this but just wanted to double-check. What is your employment status? Full time, part time, full time school, part time school, or unemployed.",8/1/15,C39,106,SUB, Unemployed.,8/1/15,C39,107,INT, Unemployed. What is your insurance status?,8/1/15,C39,108,SUB, I have Medicaid and Medicare.,8/1/15,C39,109,INT," Ok. And then last question is what is your estimated household income? The categories that I had put were either under $25,000; $25,000 - $50,000; or above $50,000.",8/1/15,C39,110,SUB," Household income, Iêd say (pauses) above $50,000.",8/1/15,C39,111,INT," Ok, great. Yeah, so thatês the very last question then. Thanks for being able to help me out with those demographics and stuff. Itês just so we get a better idea of the range of different types of participants within this mindfulness class. Just sort of helps with when I try to replicate this study or go to a larger group of people, I have an idea of who itês already been tried on and who it hasnêt been tried on yet. So all of that is very helpful. But Iêd just like to thank you again. Thatês pretty much all of the questions that I have for you, so unless you have any questions for me thatês pretty much it. And like I said Iêd sent to you the last check for $50 so that was sent, I think, last Monday / Tuesday, and it usually takes Duke a couple days to process these things, and then send it out through the snail mail, through the USPS. So hopefully you should get it by the end of this week, Friday. If not Friday, Monday. If you donêt get it then, feel free to give me a text message, you know, call, and then Iêll go talk with the financial people and hunt down the check and see whatês happened to it. But otherwise, you got the first check for $10, correct?",8/1/15,C39,112,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,113,INT," Ok, cool. And then I donêt know if I told you or not but I was out of town for the pretty much the whole month of July / August which is why I wasnêt able to send that second check there. So then in order to compensate I figured it was just as easy to throw together the last two payments of $20 and the $30 and so one check to just make it easier, so donêt need to worry about sending a bunch of checks, and itês also cheaper as well because postage still costs quite a bit of money, amazingly.",8/1/15,C39,114,SUB, Right. So your dad is doing ok?,8/1/15,C39,115,INT," No, he ended up passing away. He had two different types of cancer actually. So he was battling that for the last 2-1/2 years and he was on chemo off and on. I think that just sort of tired him out which I think would tire any normal person out. And he was getting older and stuff, so he had an uphill battle. But I was able to see him before he passed away.",8/1/15,C39,116,SUB," Oh, Iêm sorry.",8/1/15,C39,117,INT," Yeah. So it was definitely a difficult time but for as bad as it was, everything works out eventually. It just sort of € I was glad I was able to get home for a little bit and help out my mom and my little brother and stuff. ",8/1/15,C39,118,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,119,INT," Yeah. It definitely wasnêt a very happy trip to California. Usually when I go back home to California I go over there with a smile on and stuff like that. I still had a smile on, it just wasnêt € no one really wants to make that sort of trip out.",8/1/15,C39,120,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,121,INT," Thank you for asking though. I guess thatês how things go. He had leukemia and also lymphoma, and the type of leukemia he had was a very rare type where with € it was a rare lymphoma where you usually € lymphoma is usually located in the lymph nodes, which is why itês called lymphoma. But his was located inside of his heart which made it pretty difficult to treat, and they werenêt sure what type of treatment they wanted to use and what kind of drugs and all that sort of stuff, so it was kind of a difficult case to manage. But he got € he still got € I think from the time he was diagnosed to the time he passed away he had additional 2-1/2 years to live. Otherwise, if he wouldnêt have gotten any treatment he probably would have died 2-1/2 years ago. So Iêm happy he at least got a little extra time and he had a long life, and all that sort of stuff. But thatês the way things go, unfortunately. We all canêt live till weêre 200 years old.",8/1/15,C39,122,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,123,INT, I donêt know if weêd want to live till weêre 200 with the way things are going.,8/1/15,C39,124,SUB, I donêt know if anybody wants to nowadays.,8/1/15,C39,125,INT," Yeah. But thanks again, and Iêll still be around the clinic and stuff like that. I got about another year or so left here over at Duke and Iêll still be working in the clinic Monday through Friday, typically in the mornings, so Iêll look out for you and Iêll definitely catch up with you the next time I see you in the clinics for another clinical appointment. Because youêll still be seeing € I guess youêll still be seeing an OB/GYN specialist in addition to (name redacted) or Dr. (name redacted) in the next month or so, correct?",8/1/15,C39,126,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,127,INT," Yeah, just for the post-op or € for the €",8/1/15,C39,128,SUB," Post-partum, yeah.",8/1/15,C39,129,INT, Follow-up.,8/1/15,C39,130,SUB, Mm hm. Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,131,INT," All right, so thanks again. Donêt want to take up too much of your time here. But it was great meeting with you and talking with you. And I will definitely look forward to seeing you more, and like I said Iêll e-mail you those audio recordings now so if you want to keep on practicing or just to have some sort of audio tapes, so if you ever want to go back and try some of this mindfulness stuff again youêll at least have some material to start with.",8/1/15,C39,132,SUB, Ok.,8/1/15,C39,133,INT," All right, I hope your recovery is very short and everything gets back to normal, and congratulations again with your new little baby girl.",8/1/15,C39,134,SUB, Thank you.,8/1/15,C39,135,INT," All right (name redacted), thank you again.",8/1/15,C39,136,SUB, Ok. You take care.,8/1/15,C39,137,INT, All right thanks. Bye.,8/1/15,C39,138,SUB, Bye bye.,8/1/15,C
