Sub,Line,Speaker,Text,Date93,1,INT, Hey (name redacted) is that you?,11/1/1593,2,SUB, Yes sir.,11/1/1593,3,INT," All right, great. Thanks again for your participation and everything, and hopefully you were able to get a few new tips and tricks and things you were able to help yourself with from the participation. These questions that I will be asking you are all open-ended, there are no right or wrong answers. Like I said earlier, the intention of this is just to sort of learn more about your perspective on the program to help me make it better. The very first question is how easy or how difficult was it for you to call in to the weekly mindfulness sessions?",11/1/1593,4,SUB, It was easy for me. I have a (unintelligible) and I wasnêt going nowhere at 6,11/1/1593,5,INT," Ok. So it was pretty easy to call in, and then in terms of the time, the calls being in the evening, that worked out well with your schedule?",11/1/1593,6,SUB, Yes.,11/1/1593,7,INT," Ok, great.",11/1/1593,8,SUB, And even if I had forgotten that day you would let me know to call 30 minutes or 15 minutes before.,11/1/1593,9,INT, Mm hm. Yeah. So those text messages and those reminders were pretty useful.,11/1/1593,10,SUB, Mm hm.,11/1/1593,11,INT," Ok, great. Yeah, I feel a lot of people appreciated those just as a little reminder since schedules and stuff usually get fairly busy. So thatês great. So next question is what impact do you feel this mindfulness program had on your perceptions of pain?",11/1/1593,12,SUB," It helped me put my mind somewhere else. You know, it just helped you relax. When you in pain, your body tenses up and it hurts more. And when you relax, it donêt send it all away but it relax it.",11/1/1593,13,INT," Would you be able to give me an example. So letês say you were experiencing pain, what would you do in order to get relaxed?",11/1/1593,14,SUB," I lay down and you know how she Ä how your breathing Ä go from your toes Ä from tops to bottoms? And that ease it out. Because I donêt like taking pain pills, too much pain pills.",11/1/1593,15,INT, Yeah. So the breathing exercises really helped.,11/1/1593,16,SUB, Mm hm.,11/1/1593,17,INT, Ok. So that was about pain. So how do you feel Ä or do you feel the mindfulness program had any impact on your quality of life?,11/1/1593,18,SUB," Sure. It helped you not get angry quick. You know, it helped that. Take a deep breath.",11/1/1593,19,INT," Ok, so it had Ä it helped you with additional issues outside of pain. Or it had other sort of positive effects outside of pain.",11/1/1593,20,SUB," Yep. And when I was having trouble sleeping, you know when youêre laying there trying to go to sleep and your mind be wandering it helps you concentrate instead of your mind Ä",11/1/1593,21,INT," So in terms of Ä just to summarize there, with your sleeping it helped you, I guess relax a little bit more to make falling asleep easier?",11/1/1593,22,SUB, Yes.,11/1/1593,23,INT," Great. Letês see. Is there any other sort of examples? Or would you say that in terms of improving quality of life, so improving non-pain symptoms that the mindfulness program had the most benefit toward falling asleep in the evenings, or is there anything else?",11/1/1593,24,SUB," If thereês another way to relax the stress throughout the day, to relax.",11/1/1593,25,INT," Mm hm. Ok, so if youêd be feeling stressed out during the daytime youêd use this as a way of relaxing?",11/1/1593,26,SUB, Yeah.,11/1/1593,27,INT," Ok, got it. So next question is what did you find most useful about this mindfulness program?",11/1/1593,28,SUB," You were talking to other people that have sickle cell and going through the same symptoms you going through. And to me it was good. Itês another way to work without using pain pills and running to the hospital. You know, sometimes when you in crisis there ainêt nothing to do. (unintelligible) It was nice, you know, communication. And for an hour youêre making yourself (unintelligible) day. Because you know sometimes you just, you go through pain you just keep going on trying to do everything and not learn. I liked it.",11/1/1593,29,INT," So it sounds like with the group interaction, having the multiple people on the same call, that was something you really enjoyed?",11/1/1593,30,SUB, Mm hm. I really enjoyed that.,11/1/1593,31,INT," And then your sister was also on as well, right?",11/1/1593,32,SUB, Yes.,11/1/1593,33,INT, Yeah. So you got to spend some time talking with her during the program.,11/1/1593,34,SUB, Yes.,11/1/1593,35,INT, Were there any practices that you like the most or found the most beneficial in terms of helping you deal with pain episodes?,11/1/1593,36,SUB, I liked the breathing.,11/1/1593,37,INT," Ok, so the mindful breathing exercise. The one youêre talking about, the head to toe, or toe to head.",11/1/1593,38,SUB," Yeah, I loved that one.",11/1/1593,39,INT, That was something you would apply on a day-to-day basis?,11/1/1593,40,SUB, Yes. And I liked the one give out good thoughts.,11/1/1593,41,INT, Uh huh.,11/1/1593,42,SUB," You know, show kindness, think kind thoughts. ",11/1/1593,43,INT," Letês see. Ok. The sort of opposite question then, is there anything that you didnêt find helpful within this program or within the mindful exercises? Anything that you feel you could have done without?",11/1/1593,44,SUB, Mm mm. Everything was good to me. I liked everything.,11/1/1593,45,INT, Great. So you were sort of able to take away something from each of the different exercises and found them equally useful?,11/1/1593,46,SUB, Mm hm.,11/1/1593,47,INT," Ok. Cool. Is there anything that you would have wanted more of in this mindfulness program, like more talking time, more emphasis on a certain practice, those are just some examples I could think of, but is there anything that you could think of that you would have wanted more of?",11/1/1593,48,SUB," I think it was a good list on everything. And at the end, even sometime in the middle, she was comfortable for us. I think it was good. I think everything was good.",11/1/1593,49,INT," Ok, great. So not too much to complain about.",11/1/1593,50,SUB, Mm mm.,11/1/1593,51,INT," Ok, great. Then the next question I think youêve already sort of answered it but Iêll still ask it is, is there anything that you would not want within the program, or is there anything that you would eliminate?",11/1/1593,52,SUB," No. Because you would learn something new every week. And at the beginning she would go back over the same views, learn and ask you have you used it that week, and then she would teach you something else to use. I liked it.",11/1/1593,53,INT," So you liked how the class was set up in terms of the first half was a sort of review of what was previously discussed and talking about the next practice, and the second half of the class is actual practice of that new skill. You sort of like how that was set up?",11/1/1593,54,SUB, Yep. I like how that was set up.,11/1/1593,55,INT," Cool. Only two, three more questions and then thatês it, so just about done. How difficult or easy was it for you to practice the mindfulness exercises outside of the weekly telephone calls?",11/1/1593,56,SUB," It was easy because at night you could help relax yourself when youêre going to bed. During the daytime when somebody getting an attitude, you know, you step back _ you know they always say take a deep breath and donêt respond.",11/1/1593,57,INT," Yeah, sure.",11/1/1593,58,SUB," And even when people get on your nerves you think good thoughts about them, try to think good thoughts about them. And when you were eating it would help you concentrate on your food. Because you know, sometimes youêre like spoon-mouth, spoon-mouth, spoon-mouth. It gives you a chance to relax too.",11/1/1593,59,INT," Yeah, so it sounds like you were able to think of a number of ways of practicing during the week that you found fairly easy.",11/1/1593,60,SUB, Mm hm.,11/1/1593,61,INT," Great. So now since the program, the classes have finished, do you intend to continue using what you have learned from this mindfulness class?",11/1/1593,62,SUB," Yes, I use the breathing every day. I love the breathing one.",11/1/1593,63,INT, Great.,11/1/1593,64,SUB," And you know what is good? Relax your body to me, it gives you a chance _ to me _ to take note of whatês going on in your body.",11/1/1593,65,INT," Mm hm. So how have you found that to be helpful, if you might be able to explain a little bit about that, thatês something Iêm interested in. So with the mindfulness youêre saying that youêre now more in tune with what your body is telling you. Does that mean you have a better sense of when a pain episode might occur, and youêre able to sort of calm down and prepare yourself and decrease the stressors? Is that sort of what youêre getting at or is it something else?",11/1/1593,66,SUB," Yes. It helps me relieve the stress (unintelligible) hurt more to, make it hurt worse too.",11/1/1593,67,INT, Mm hm.,11/1/1593,68,SUB," And it let you know, you know, you just relax and concentrate on that spot, no from head to toe, and not just at that spot. Because to me, I do not like taking pain pills that much. Too much. I donêt like to have to lay down and go to sleep. But it helps me to relax my body with the pain pills I donêt have to take too much of it. And it help me, you know, specifically know if this is going to be a worse one or can I just relax to it.",11/1/1593,69,INT," Great. So it sounds like youêve really been able to learn how to focus more on what your body has been telling you, it sounds like. Is that a good Ä does that sound about right?",11/1/1593,70,SUB, Yes. Thatês it.,11/1/1593,71,INT, Awesome. Hm. So then my final question for you then is would you recommend this type of mindfulness program to someone else with sickle cell and pain.,11/1/1593,72,SUB," Yes, and I would tell them to take the class just to learn something new, and even with the people around them, like one time my nephew, my great-nephew, was staying with me and especially doing the breathing thing. He enjoyed listening to it, he enjoyed going through it too. Involve your family and it will help you.",11/1/1593,73,INT," I was going to say you would sort of recommend it to even people that donêt have pain or a chronic illness or sickle cell, that it could be used by anybody?",11/1/1593,74,SUB," Yes. It would help you stay calm. It would help you get to know your body. And it will help you relax. Because people will blow up angry quick. And some people even (unintelligible) and keep trying to do what they doing. And some people just need to relax. It will make you less stressful. And there for an hour, or even for 10 minutes, you got a moment to yourself. I would recommend it to anybody. Everybody I know.",11/1/1593,75,INT," Great. So that pretty much wraps up the questions that I had specifically for you. Is there anything else that you would like me to know about your experience about other ways that this program might have potentially helped you that I might have not addressed within these questions, or any recommendations for how I might be able to improve it?",11/1/1593,76,SUB, No. I loved it. I loved how it was set up.,11/1/1593,77,INT, Great. Sorry.,11/1/1593,78,SUB," I just cleared a moment, an hour on a Tuesday just for yourself, clear your schedule just to pay attention to yourself and just doing the conference. I liked it.",11/1/1593,79,INT," Great. Well thank you again, (name redacted) for taking the time to help me with some of these questions. Itês very much appreciated and Iêm very happy that you were able to use some of the techniques from this program to improve your pain management. I think thatês wonderful. So what Iêll do is Iêll check back in with you in about two weeks to make sure you that youêve gotten that last paycheck and then what Iêm probably going to do now is try to call your sister and see if I could ask her the same sort of questions and get her thoughts and perspectives on this program. Do you know what time of day might be best to contact her at?",11/1/1593,80,SUB, I called her yesterday around this time. She was at home. Sheês been going through crisis with the weather.,11/1/1593,81,INT, Oh. Really?,11/1/1593,82,SUB, Yeah. And her granddaughter going to for (unintelligible) support. It would be best to contact her now because he granddaughter get out at 2,11/1/1593,83,INT," Ok. Iêll try to give her a call, or Iêll try to reach her sometime this week. But thanks again and Iêll check back with you in about two weeks or so then?",11/1/1593,84,SUB, Ok.,11/1/1593,85,INT," All right, (name redacted). Thank you again.",11/1/1593,86,SUB, Bye.,11/1/1593,87,INT, All right. Bye.,11/1/15
