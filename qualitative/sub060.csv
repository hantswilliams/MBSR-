Sub,Line,Speaker,Text,Date60,1,INT," Thanks for being able to take a couple minutes of your time. Itês fairly brief and stuff like that. I just wanted to thank you again for being able to call in to the mindfulness classes, and hopefully you were able to get a few things out of it that you previously werenêt aware of and Iêm sure it was overall just a different experience than anything youêve probably tried previously. So like I said, thank you again for your participation, and also so you got the check sent to you in the mail for $50. That was sent to Duke last week and it takes a couple days to process and mail out, so hopefully you should get that check by the end of this week. Just keep me up-to-date. If you donêt get it by, say, Friday, Iêll be able to call and find out whatês going on with it there.",9/1/1560,2,SUB, Ok.,9/1/1560,3,INT," So Iêve just got 10 very simple, basic questions for you regarding mindfulness to help me get a better idea of what sort of worked and what didnêt work and stuff like that. The first question is Ä Iêll just sort of walk through them and you can just give me a brief answer or as detailed as you want. Thereês not really any sort of set-up to it. The first question is if youêd be able to tell me how easy or how difficult it was for you to call in to these mindfulness sessions.",9/1/1560,4,SUB, Can you hear me now? I had it on mute. It wasnêt that difficult. ,9/1/1560,5,INT, Ok. So in terms of the timing of the sessions and stuff like that Ä,9/1/1560,6,SUB," Well the timing was off because I was at work when I had to call, so thatês why I forgot about it.",9/1/1560,7,INT," Oh yeah. You were calling in during your work hours, right?",9/1/1560,8,SUB," Right. Right. But when I got home I tried to, but sometimes I got home late and be able to sleep.",9/1/1560,9,INT, And did that sort of help? Did you find that useful to help you go to sleep?,9/1/1560,10,SUB," Yes, I did.",9/1/1560,11,INT," Yeah. So other than sleep, did this mindfulness program have an effect on your perceptions of pain, of the physically chronic pain?",9/1/1560,12,SUB," A little bit, Iêd say. Not much.",9/1/1560,13,INT, Ok. So a little bit but not too much.,9/1/1560,14,SUB, Uh huh.,9/1/1560,15,INT," And so outside of chronic pain, how about sort of larger quality of life Ä so quality of life meaning like your daily activities, you know, getting up or going to work Ä",9/1/1560,16,SUB, It helped me relax more.,9/1/1560,17,INT, So what would be an example of how it helped you relax more?,9/1/1560,18,SUB," It never did (unintelligible) as quickly. Just keep calm, and breathe easily, relax.",9/1/1560,19,INT," So like Ä would it help you relax while youêd be at work, or dealing with something at home sort of situation, or sort of in what context in terms of the Ä can you think of any specific situation or was it more sort of broad?",9/1/1560,20,SUB," Broad, everyday living.",9/1/1560,21,INT, Ok.,9/1/1560,22,SUB, Yeah. ,9/1/1560,23,INT," Ok. So with this mindfulness class, what did you find most useful about it?",9/1/1560,24,SUB," Like I said, more the relaxation than the pain. It did help to ease the pain some, you know? Take your mind off the pain.",9/1/1560,25,INT," And then how about what do you think was the least useful aspect of this mindfulness class? Like what do you feel you didnêt really get out of it, or was there any sort of exercise in particular that you feel wasnêt that useful?",9/1/1560,26,SUB," Everything was useful, you know, get that quality time to do it while I was at work, while she was talking through it. I was telling her I need the CD. I never did get the CD in my package.",9/1/1560,27,INT," Ok, yeah, my bad about that. What Iêll do though is Iêm going to take a note of that now. If you want I can still send that to you.",9/1/1560,28,SUB," Yeah, send that to me.",9/1/1560,29,INT," Yeah, so you can still listen through it. ",9/1/1560,30,SUB," Right, right.",9/1/1560,31,INT," So actually I have your e-mail have your e-mail here. So if you want I can either send you a digital copy so itês just a couple of MP3 files that I could send to your e-mail, or I could send you a physical sort of CD disc copy. Do you have any sort of preference?",9/1/1560,32,SUB, You can send it to my e-mail.,9/1/1560,33,INT," Ok, great. Yeah. What Iêll do then is once weêre done talking, I believe itês like 5 or 6 small little MP3 files Ä",9/1/1560,34,SUB, What e-mail do you have for me?,9/1/1560,35,INT, The one I got is (redacted),9/1/1560,36,SUB," Yeah, thatês it.

But Iêll send those to you and you can listen through them and that might be some sort of way of keeping up with some of the practices that you find more useful.",9/1/1560,40,SUB," Yeah, Iêd like to.",9/1/1560,41,INT," Cool. All right, so is there any part of this mindfulness class that you would have liked to have more experience with or more interaction with?",9/1/1560,42,SUB," Not really. Probably one part of it. See, like I said by me being on the road at the time of the conference call I couldnêt give my full attention to it but I would like the CD part so I could go back and listen to it during my regular hours. I can listen to it and think about things. I liked the class though. I liked it though.",9/1/1560,43,INT," All right, just in terms of having that extra sort of homework material, or sort of practice tapes.",9/1/1560,44,SUB, Yeah. Yes.,9/1/1560,45,INT, Ok. Next question. I think youêve already sort of answered it but is there anything that you  would eliminate or have less of in the mindfulness class?,9/1/1560,46,SUB," No, itês not. No.",9/1/1560,47,INT," Ok. Letês see. Next question youêve already answered as well but Iêll still ask it. Thereês only two more questions. Tell me about how easy or difficult it was for you to practice mindfulness and complete the homework assignments. So it just seems like difficulty there but that was just due to my own error and not being able to get you those practice tapes. Otherwise, you probably would have liked to have listened to them on that weekly basis.",9/1/1560,48,SUB, Yes.,9/1/1560,49,INT, Do you continue on using the mindfulness practices that you learned during this program?,9/1/1560,50,SUB," Yes, I am.

Ok, great. Yeah. So that was pretty much the little brief questions. Is there anything else youêd like to tell me about your experience within this mindfulness class that I might have not covered? Any concerns or questions?",9/1/1560,56,SUB, Theyêre covered.,9/1/1560,57,INT," Ok, cool. So then I just have 3 _ 4 questions in terms of your demographic information that I never collected earlier. These are all extremely simple. This will probably take 30 seconds for me to ask you. I already have about half of them. ",9/1/1560,58,SUB, Ok.,9/1/1560,59,INT, Youêre male. Whatês your age?,9/1/1560,60,SUB,48,9/1/1560,61,INT," 48.
