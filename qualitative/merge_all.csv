Sub,Line,Speaker,Text,Date,Participant4,1,INT," There are 10 questions, pretty brief and straight-forward just to get your thoughts on the program. So the very first is if you could talk to me about how easy or difficult it was for you to complete the weekly mindfulness sessions.",7/6/11,A4,2,SUB, The conference call?,7/6/11,A4,3,INT, Correct.,7/6/11,A4,4,SUB," Yeah, so that was fairly easy. It was just a matter of making sure I remembered to call in at the right time and I think you all did a great job sending reminder e-mails and reminder text messages.",7/6/11,A4,5,INT," Ok, cool. So like in terms of being able to call in and listen for the full 60 minutes, was that relatively easy or did you feel like that time period was too long or too short to be able to sort of understand what was going on, and to really try and have enough time to grasp the concepts that the instructor was talking about?",7/6/11,A4,6,SUB," I think that an hour was appropriate. It was enough time for the leader to go through the specific concepts and meditation types that we talked about, and also enough time for — to provide feedback and have discussions about it.",7/6/11,A4,7,INT," Ok, cool. So — what question was I going to ask? Something you had mentioned. So in terms of calling in then with the telephone, was that relatively easy for you in terms of that being an acceptable form of communication?",7/6/11,A4,8,SUB," Yeah, I think that worked out really well, particularly the conference calls where we were all able to hear each other — we were all able to have a discussion, have a conversation. The conference call is a good format. I think I like that more so than having to come to a place and be there in person. I was more comfortable in my own space.",7/6/11,A4,9,INT, It definitely sounds like a convenience factor.,7/6/11,A4,10,SUB, Yes. Definitely more convenient. And another alternative.,7/6/11,A4,11,INT," Yeah. I guess that was sort of the hope there, to try and make it as easy as possible. Ok, cool, so —",7/6/11,A4,12,SUB," Because of the time, I think, doing it later in the evening, would work better because 5",7/6/11,A4,13,INT," Ok, cool. Yeah, we actually had — I got a similar comment from someone else that was in the class with you that it seems like 5 pm might not have been the most ideal time. Itês sort of rush hour time. Everyone is either leaving work, or trying to go home, or eating dinner. Thereês definitely something going on. So we were able to take that feedback to where our next group and scheduled them at 3 pm instead of 5 pm, sort of taking that into account because sort of figured that out about halfway through, I think, maybe 5 pm wasnêt the best time. But it had to do with the hours available for the instructor and stuff like that. But trying to make that a little bit easier. So, ok, in terms of the overall impact of this mindfulness program, do you feel it had any effects on your perception of chronic pain, or your pain experience?",7/6/11,A4,14,SUB," In terms of the chronic nature of my pain, no, itês still there, itês still pervasive. But Iêve noticed that when I have spikes of pain, when it gets worse, being able to kind of sit down and calm myself and meditate has been helpful. Kind of like really acute episodes.",7/6/11,A4,15,INT," Ok, so less so with the chronic, lingering, nagging sort of type of pain but more so with the acute sort of short bursts of pain episodes. So what would an example be of, say, acute pain that you have experienced where you then perform some sort of meditative practice, or is there any that you might be able to think of that you can provide as an example?",7/6/11,A4,16,SUB," I canêt think of any certain examples during the duration but I have been meditating, for example, is today Friday? Wednesday, I was at work in my office and I had a spike of pain in my right arm, and so I just closed my laptop, got into a meditative posture in my chair, and tried to focus on breathing.",7/6/11,A4,17,INT," Ok, cool. So that was doing the breathing exercise then?",7/6/11,A4,18,SUB," Yes, the breathing exercise. Correct.",7/6/11,A4,19,INT, Ok.,7/6/11,A4,20,SUB," I found that to be the most helpful of the techniques that we learned. There was one, the body scan, wasnêt helpful to me. Itês focusing on the area where the pain is coming from, for me personally, isnêt helpful. It makes it worse. For me to focus on the breath is definitely helpful.",7/6/11,A4,21,INT, Ok.,7/6/11,A4,22,SUB, Just remembering to breathe and all that. Itês helpful.,7/6/11,A4,23,INT," Great, so it sounds like youêve been able to incorporate in at least that one practice into your daily activities or your ... or how you manage pain.",7/6/11,A4,24,SUB," Definitely, definitely, yeah. It even helps with having anxiety. I use meditation for anxiety too. And itês a similar experience where it isnêt as helpful for chronic worry, or chronic anxiety or pain, but for acute episodes or when I felt panicky, meditating in the moment is helpful.",7/6/11,A4,25,INT," Ok. Right. So I think you sort of answered my next question, what did you find most useful about the mindfulness program, and it sounds like the breathing exercises youêve been able to find pretty useful in terms of managing pain. But in terms of the program, what do you think was the least useful skill or part that you were taught?",7/6/11,A4,26,SUB," I donêt recall the name of it but it was positive affirmations, the one where youêre kind of sending positive feelings to yourself. That one wasnêt very helpful for me. And also the body scan. It wasnêt helpful either. But I can see how that would work for other people. Just personally it didnêt.",7/6/11,A4,27,INT," Ok, got it. So itês just like — I guess it just doesnêt really work with your way of self-management.",7/6/11,A4,28,SUB, Exactly. Exactly. But I do appreciate knowing that technique.,7/6/11,A4,29,INT, What did you think of the eating exercise?,7/6/11,A4,30,SUB," That one was really interesting. Iêm kind of a slow eater so itês something that I kind of do naturally or unconsciously, try to think about the food that Iêm eating, where it comes from, what it feels like, what it tastes like, and just really enjoying the food.",7/6/11,A4,31,INT," Yeah, just kind of taking your time and experiencing all the smells and the textures and all of the sort of movement of the jaw and that sort of stuff?",7/6/11,A4,32,SUB," Right. Right. And normally, before I focused on the taste or maybe think about where it came from, but putting all of those different aspects _ taste, texture, origin, all that into one exercise was interesting. It was fun.",7/6/11,A4,33,INT," Yeah. Yeah. Thatês definitely one of those interesting exercises which makes you think about things that you donêt normally think about, especially things that are very mundane and everyday activities like eating that we donêt typically give a lot of thought to, which is kind of interesting. People either, I feel, really like it or they are just sort of confused by it.",7/6/11,A4,34,SUB, I can see that. Yeah.,7/6/11,A4,35,INT, So next question. Is there any part of the mindfulness program that you would have liked to have more practice with or more emphasis with in the program that you feel you might have benefitted from more practice or more information from?,7/6/11,A4,36,SUB," Visualization, so thinking about different places while youêre meditating. Because one of the things that Iêve learned with pain is that if I can focus on something else or visualize something then that is helpful in reducing my pain. In the past Iêve imagined a black hole and then pushing my pain into that black hole. And sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesnêt. But I think that having some kind of formal instruction in that would be helpful.",7/6/11,A4,37,INT," Ok, so something more with visualization then.",7/6/11,A4,38,SUB, Right. Right.,7/6/11,A4,39,INT, Ok. So thatês something that you would want more of. Is there anything within the program you feel that you would — that you think might or should be eliminated or less time or emphasis should be placed on?,7/6/11,A4,40,SUB," No, from what I recall, at least one person got something out of all the activities that we did, so I think it was a good balance. ",7/6/11,A4,41,INT, Ok. So itês pretty well-balanced. ,7/6/11,A4,42,SUB, Mm hm. (yes),7/6/11,A4,43,INT," All right. Letês see. Three more questions. So in terms of the practicing of the mindfulness outside of the one hour weekly telephone call, was that difficult to find time to practice the skills that the instructor was teaching in terms of the actual practice, or in trying to find the time or place to practice, and sort of incorporating it into your schedule?",7/6/11,A4,44,SUB," For me, yes. Less so finding a place, but just being deliberate about practicing for 15 minutes a day. Yeah. I didnêt always meditate every day. Yeah, so no. It wasnêt that it was difficult. Itês just that I didnêt always practice outside of it.",7/6/11,A4,45,INT, Ok. It sounds like youêre breaking up a little bit there so I got part of it. So it sounds like it wasnêt too difficult to practice but itês just hard to find the time within the days to practice?,7/6/11,A4,46,SUB, Correct. Yes.,7/6/11,A4,47,INT," Cool. Got it. So letês see. So now that youêve finished with the mindfulness program, I think you already sort of answered this, do you plan on continuing to practice these sort of meditative skills and techniques you were taught? It sounded like you had provided me with an example earlier, you were saying last Friday or whatever, of having an acute pain episode and being able to do the breathing exercise. But Iêll let you answer.",7/6/11,A4,48,SUB," Yes. Definitely something that I want to continue to do. And I think itês very helpful, not just for the pain but also for well-being.",7/6/11,A4,49,INT," Ok, so more like a general quality-of-life.",7/6/11,A4,50,SUB, Exactly.,7/6/11,A4,51,INT, Cool. Letês see. Would you recommend a mindfulness program like this to a friend or to another person with sickle cell?,7/6/11,A4,52,SUB," Yes, definitely I would. It would be helpful for anyone with chronic pain, and just people in general. Meditation is something a lot of people can benefit from.",7/6/11,A4,53,INT," Yeah. I definitely agree with you there. Itês one of those things that I feel like the hardest aspect of practices like these is just getting into the routine of doing it on a daily basis, or setting aside a specific time within your schedule to sort of try to incorporate it in; but then once you do, it becomes a lot easier and you start to see more of the positive benefits. Just like anything else, when you first get started with it, it can be a little bit difficult to get into the groove of things but —",7/6/11,A4,54,SUB, Exactly. Exactly.,7/6/11,A4,55,INT, Yeah. But —,7/6/11,A4,56,SUB, I agree that getting into the habit is difficult. Being deliberate about setting aside time to do it.,7/6/11,A4,57,INT, Whatês your normal — is your job Monday through Friday?,7/6/11,A4,58,SUB," Primarily, yes, but I also work on the weekends. So Iêm in grad school. Iêm not taking classes now but teaching courses.",7/6/11,A4,59,INT," Yeah, because youêre doing your PhD in psych, right?",7/6/11,A4,60,SUB, Yes. Yes.,7/6/11,A4,61,INT, Yeah. ,7/6/11,A4,62,SUB, Teaching and also developing a course.,7/6/11,A4,63,INT, Oh. Cool. What — which course are you working on?,7/6/11,A4,64,SUB," So itês for my preliminary exams, developing a course on virtual communities, how theyêre constructed, what they look like, how you characterize a virtual community, but also how they can be used as a form of emotional support.",7/6/11,A4,65,INT, Ok.,7/6/11,A4,66,SUB," For a member, but also for people with health conditions, a chronic medical condition.",7/6/11,A4,67,INT," That definitely sounds quite interesting. I was listening — when I was driving earlier this morning I was listening to a podcast and they were talking about the applications of that game, Minecraft and how thatês being used in a lot of educational settings and stuff now, not only to teach history lessons and things about the government but also incorporating in social skills and how it all sort of blends together. I thought it was really interesting. I wasnêt really aware that programs like Minecraft _ I was aware of it as like a video game but not as an actual virtual world where people are interacting and you can pretty much do whatever you want to do.",7/6/11,A4,68,SUB," Yeah. I never played Minecraft but I think — I havenêt heard that podcast but Iêve seen a couple of studies that talked about it in terms of social aspects. And also hand-eye coordination and a couple other things. But yeah, yeah, the games are really interesting. They are a form of virtual community.",7/6/11,A4,69,INT," Yeah, so itês going to be interesting to see where all this technology goes, especially with the new DR and youêre incorporating in new things from the virtual and the actual real world, and how all thatês going to be integrated in, and what the effects are, in a sort of way of interacting with other human beings and, I guess non-human beings. Itês going to be quite intriguing. But yeah, so thatês like pretty much it though in terms of the questions. Is there anything else that you want me to know about your overall experience that I might have not touched on?",7/6/11,A4,70,SUB, No.,7/6/11,A4,71,INT," Anything that might have stood out, you know, anything strange.",7/6/11,A4,72,SUB, Oh. The survey. So we did 3-on-1 surveys? Once in the beginning then halfway through and one at the end? So I think — So — I wasnêt very good about tracking my meditation with the log but I think it would have been easier if there were a question that asked how many hours did you spend meditating on the last two or three.,7/6/11,A4,73,INT," Ok, got it. So like some sort of digital version of that form that you could just go onto the Web and fill out?",7/6/11,A4,74,SUB, Right. Right. Incorporate it into the survey.,7/6/11,A4,75,INT," Ok, cool. I was thinking about different ways of doing that because I guess youêre sort of like on the computer every single day with e-mail and everything else. Itês not that big of a deal. But for individuals that may not be as computer-savvy or who have less access, you then need to go from going on the computer from once a day, or once every couple of days to every day just to fill out this log. That was my only hesitancy there, but I definitely do want to make that as an option though, because itês a lot easier for me to store, track, and collect the information. Because hard copies of anything is always a big pain in the butt, dealing with the post office and the mail being lost. Like you said that you were just moving so — there was a paycheck that — who knows where it is.",7/6/11,A4,76,SUB," Yeah, so that was the only thing I can think of. ",7/6/11,A4,77,INT," Ok, cool.",7/6/11,A4,78,SUB," You could use an app or something, just something to track it daily.",7/6/11,A4,79,INT," Oh yeah. In the ideal situation, yeah, Iêd get a lot of the funding and give everyone _ you know _ iPads or whatever, so youêd have a nice, easy way of filling everything out. That would be the ideal situation, and then you get a free iPad as well.",7/6/11,A4,80,SUB, That would be great.,7/6/11,A4,81,INT, All right. Iêll be sure to take note of that so when Iêm asking for more money I can tell them that people are requesting for iPads so I need an extra couple thousand dollars.,7/6/11,A4,82,SUB, There you go.,7/6/11,A4,83,INT," All right, great. Thanks again for your participation and helping me out with the study. And just shoot me a text, or give me a call, if you havenêt gotten that last paycheck forwarded to you, and if there is any sort of problem there Iêve got your new address now and weêll be able to resend out that last check. So you got the one for $10 and the one for $20, itês just the last one for $30 that you still need then, correct?",7/6/11,A4,84,SUB, Correct. Yes.,7/6/11,A4,85,INT," Ok, cool, so you know, just shoot me a text then within like a week or two if it hasnêt come and then Iêll get the paperwork going on that and then Iêll let you know once Duke sends it out, so we can get that all squared away.",7/6/11,A4,86,SUB," All right, sounds good. Thanks.",7/6/11,A4,87,INT," All right, cool (name redacted). Best of luck with your program also. So youêll be doing — so youêve already done the prelims then or thatês going to be coming up?",7/6/11,A4,88,SUB, Iêm doing it now so I have until September to finish developing the course.,7/6/11,A4,89,INT, Got it. So you have summer and then — well I guess summer now is almost gone which is crazy.,7/6/11,A4,90,SUB, I know.,7/6/11,A4,91,INT," I always think Iêm going to get a lot of stuff done over the summer and then itês the end of summer and Iêm left scratching my head, wondering what I was doing.",7/6/11,A4,92,SUB, Exactly.,7/6/11,A4,93,INT," But thatês the way things end up going. But all right, cool, thanks again, and just give me a call if you have any questions. Iêll be more than happy to answer them. Otherwise, Iêll probably see you in clinic. Iêll still be hanging around there next year.",7/6/11,A4,94,SUB, All right. Sounds good.,7/6/11,A4,95,INT," All right (name redacted). Thanks again, and hopefully you have a nice, relaxing weekend.",7/6/11,A4,96,SUB, All right. Iêll try. You too.,7/6/11,A4,97,INT, All right. Thanks. Bye.,7/6/11,A4,98,SUB, Bye.,7/6/11,A7,1,INT, Are you able to hear me fine?,7/20/15,B7,2,SUB, Oh yeah. I hear you perfectly.,7/20/15,B7,3,INT," Ok, great. So itês just a couple of brief sort of questions to get your overall thoughts on the program and your experience from it, so very very basic questions. So thereês like very very brief Û should only take about 30-40 seconds for each of them, but the first one is if you can just briefly talk about either how easy or how difficult it was for you to complete the weekly telephone based mindfulness calls.",7/20/15,B7,4,SUB," Oh it was very easy. It wasnêt difficult at all. I liked the fact that you could call in to a number. You could be anywhere you didnêt necessarily be at home. You know, there were days where I didnêt feel good but it didnêt matter because I was in the comfort of my home. I could be laying down, and most of the exercises required that, you know, you were in a relaxed position anyway. So it was very easy to complete.",7/20/15,B7,5,INT," Great. So you mentioned there were a couple different places that you may have called in to. When you called in, were they mostly from your house or were they also from other places?",7/20/15,B7,6,SUB," Well, one time I called in from a hospital, I was getting an ultrasound done and I called in from there. Iêve been in the car and Iêve called in. Iêve been home. So those were the three places.",7/20/15,B7,7,INT, A little bit all over then.,7/20/15,B7,8,SUB, Yes.,7/20/15,B7,9,INT," Great. So the next question then is sort like a two-part question. So what impact, if any, do you feel this mindfulness program had on your perception of pain, and also on your quality of life?",7/20/15,B7,10,SUB," Well, the first part of that question, pain is very, very physical, but if you can get your mind to be able to control certain aspects when youêre in pain, itês not that the pain goes away, itês just that you feel stronger, more relaxed, and you can tolerate the pain better. So Iêve always found that if Iêm feeling stronger mentally, emotionally, I tolerate the pain better. So the classes offered certain specific techniques to help with that. So the quality of life is just better because of that. Because when you Û like 95% of my day is Û Iêm in pain in some form or fashion. So being able to have tools that will keep my mind strong helps me tolerate and deal with the pain.",7/20/15,B7,11,INT, Great. So it sounds like youêre able to take a couple parts of the program and incorporate them into your daily sort of life?,7/20/15,B7,12,SUB," Oh yeah. Not only that, some of the things I had been doing before I took this class, but a lot of the other things I learned I rolled it in so Iêve like custom-made something for me. Like so many times when Iêm in the car and Iêll do my breathing exercises. Or Iêll scan my body. And you know, those are things that Iêve learned, and Iêm just incorporating them when Iêm sitting in traffic I can remember so many times Iêd be in pain and so frustrated that Iêm sitting in traffic. Now I donêt feel that way anymore as much because Iêm doing my breathing exercises, Iêm scanning my body, Iêm calming myself down. So itês like any everyday thing.",7/20/15,B7,13,INT," Yeah, I was going to say we all have some form of traffic and car-related pain. And then when you have that confounded with other physical pain itês just I can imagine a not very pleasant sort of situation, especially if youêre stuck in traffic trying to go to work or wherever you might be going.",7/20/15,B7,14,SUB, Exactly.,7/20/15,B7,15,INT," It sounds like with the breathing scan Û or sorry Û with the breathing exercises and the body scan, you found those to be particularly useful. Were there any exercises or parts of the mindfulness class that you didnêt find as useful?",7/20/15,B7,16,SUB," There was the one thing with the eating. The eating exercise. I did not find that to be very useful. I think the point of that exercise was to show us awareness, to pay attention. But I remember trying to do that while I was eating and I was like _Look, I donêt have time.î Iêm a 40-year-old. Sometimes I eat when I can, so I just didnêt have the time to sit there and think about what I Û savoring the food and all that kind. Yeah. That was the only one thing that I was like _Eh. This didnêt really help me out too much.î",7/20/15,B7,17,INT," Yeah. Iêm definitely sometimes the same exact way where when Iêm starting to eat, the last thing Iêm thinking about is all the different tactile sensations and the aroma. Usually when Iêm eating itês because Iêm very very hungry, and Iêm just focused on getting it into my mouth.",7/20/15,B7,18,SUB," Yeah. Exactly. That was the one thing, but all the other exercises were very helpful.",7/20/15,B7,19,INT," Great. So is there any exercise or part of the program that you feel you wanted more of, or more explanation, or more practice?",7/20/15,B7,20,SUB," No. The way the program is set up now is really great. What I would like to see is if there was, you know, like levels. Like this one was Level 1. And Level 2 would be like, for example, you take the breathing exercises and you incorporate that with some type of physical therapy kind of situation, where, you know Û",7/20/15,B7,21,INT, Gotcha.,7/20/15,B7,22,SUB," Yeah. You know. It has to be steps. So thatês what I would like. I would like to see the program grow to where you still keep this. Itês like your introduction. Like everybody has to go through it. And then the next level, ok, so those people who are really interested in moving to the next level, you know, it would be where physically youêre also learning how to move your body, and you know, that kind of thing so you can alleviate feeling the pain. So massage therapy along with the breathing, something like Û for me, I think that would be the next step that I would love to see the program go toward, because I think that would really help with sickle cell. ",7/20/15,B7,23,INT, Ok. So sort of combining it with something else.,7/20/15,B7,24,SUB," Yeah, like what we learned Û",7/20/15,B7,25,INT," So what like would you feel sort of an example or sort of an introductory step to doing what youêre talking about would be placing some of the exercises in context to some of the specific scenarios in which you could find yourself commonly in within, say, the waiting room, or when youêre Û or a possible transfusion, pre-operative sort of readiness Û",7/20/15,B7,26,SUB," Exactly. Exactly. Like for example you know, maybe the next Û I donêt know how it works, but like you said, when youêre getting a transfusion maybe the next study would be going to people who are getting transfusions and doing it right then with them, you know, in that state, right then and there. I donêt know if you Û you wouldnêt get the same people, you know, for that period of time consistently because you donêt get a transfusion like every week kind of thing. But you would maybe get a whole lot of people right at that moment in doing it and you could get their feedback that way. Or, you know, like I said, having a class where massage therapy or physical therapy and you incorporate everything that you learned in the conference call, and you incorporate that but on top of something physical.",7/20/15,B7,27,INT," Ok. That makes sense. Yeah, thatês really good feedback. I think it would definitely be interesting to, at least for those who have a base or a foundation of what this program, or what this sort of type of technique is getting at, and then working with those individuals in the beginning to then see how it can be more adequately placed within the proper context to have a greater impact on the specific short-term Û yeah",7/20/15,B7,28,SUB, Yeah.,7/20/15,B7,29,INT," Yeah. Got it. Thatês very very helpful. So in terms of the weekly call, so how often did you find yourself practicing and was that relatively easy or difficult to set aside times to practice during the week?",7/20/15,B7,30,SUB," Actually it was easy because once, you know like I said, you start to figure out situation where you could do it _ because a lot of these exercises you could do it and someone doesnêt know youêre doing it. So I was doing my Û I was getting an ultrasound and I was on the call, and the guy knew I was on a conference call but he didnêt know what the conference call was about. So you know when youêre waiting in line at the supermarket, in the car, I have a 4-year-old, picking her up from her classes, or whatever the deal might be and then for me, I incorporate it every night where right before I go to bed, Iêm already laying down, and Iêm scanning where Iêm hurting. Because at night you focus more on the pain because you donêt have anything else to do.",7/20/15,B7,31,INT, Yeah.,7/20/15,B7,32,SUB," So that has become a daily for me. Itês just automatic now. And then it calms me down and so I can get some rest. For some people they might incorporate it in the morning. I think there are several people who said they did it in the morning time. The breathing exercises and scanning their body. So it just depends on the person, but I found many ways to just Û itês just like a part of my routine. Like in the car, automatically. Any time itês like a long pause or stop, youêre in traffic, construction, Iêm just doing my stuff.",7/20/15,B7,33,INT," Oh, great. It sounds like it was pretty easy then for you to find everyday situation in which you can apply this sort of technique and then Û",7/20/15,B7,34,SUB, Yes.,7/20/15,B7,35,INT," Great. So as you go forward then, do you see yourself _ I think you already sort of answered this but Iêll ask it anyway in a more straightforward form _ but it sounds like Û do you plan to continue using these mindfulness practices that you learned during the program?",7/20/15,B7,36,SUB, Yes. ,7/20/15,B7,37,INT, It definitely sounds like you are. So would you recommend a program like this that you just participated in to friends or to others with sickle cell?,7/20/15,B7,38,SUB, Yes.,7/20/15,B7,39,INT, And so then just the very last question then. Is there anything else that youêd like me to know about your experience or any thoughts or concerns related to the mindfulness program?,7/20/15,B7,40,SUB," I just think itês a really great program. And I think itês a great starting point, like if you guys could follow the same group of people and keep adding components and different types of studies with the same group of people so you could really see the impact from the beginning to the end to Û you know, maybe theyêd do like five different studies. So that way we can have different people Û you know theyêre participating for an extended period of time so you can like really get a good picture of, you know, what itês like and what works and what doesnêt work for sickle cell.",7/20/15,B7,41,INT, Mm. Got it. Yeah.,7/20/15,B7,42,SUB," I donêt know how easy that is to do, but you know.",7/20/15,B7,43,INT," Yeah so Iêll definitely let you know if I end up doing any sort of immediate follow-up to the study because it sounds like you are interested in continuing along with this sort of practice and general type of technique, these sorts of behavioral thinking interventions in which you can try to reframe negative thoughts and emotions, or alter them in such a way in which negative experiences arenêt necessarily as bad.",7/20/15,B7,44,SUB," Yes. I think with sickle cell, the primary way to treat it on a daily basis is to give pain meds. And, you know, with that, on daily pain med taking, there are a lot of consequences. And I think that if, you know Û itês sad. Most people follow down that road because theyêre never given the opportunity. They donêt know, theyêve never experienced another way to deal with their pain. And then pain med taking every day Û because most sickle cell patients have daily pain. So then you complicate the situation by taking pain meds every day and you end up having other issues and other problems. So I really do think if we could get away from that being the only course of treatment on daily would be so beneficial for so many people who have sickle cell with their pain on a daily basis. Take the pain meds as needed for extremely, you know, severe cases where they donêt need hospitalization but they need something to take the edge off. But they wouldnêt have all the other complications that come with medicine every day.",7/20/15,B7,45,INT," Mm. Yeah, with a lot of the pharmacological and a lot of the chronical analgesic and opioids they definitely have a wide range of negative side effects, which makes me think Û so within the mindfulness program, do you feel like it negatively affected you in any way or could you foresee it having any sort of negative impacts on you by performing these practices?",7/20/15,B7,46,SUB, No.,7/20/15,B7,47,INT, Ok,7/20/15,B7,48,SUB," No. No, not at all. Theyêre all beneficial.",7/20/15,B7,49,INT," Great. So Iêll stay in contact with you then. Well, not directly but Iêll watch out for you when you come back into clinic for any sort of quarterly check-in. I forget how often you go in to see (name redacted).",7/20/15,B7,50,SUB, Itês every 3 to 4 months for me unless something is going on.,7/20/15,B7,51,INT, Mm. Got it.,7/20/15,B7,52,SUB, My next appointment is in October.,7/20/15,B7,53,INT," Ok. Yeah. So youêre familiar with Dr. (name redacted), correct?",7/20/15,B7,54,SUB, Yes.,7/20/15,B7,55,INT," Ok, yeah. So he is one of the other pediatric sickle cell doctors there and heês actually also really interested in starting up with some more research in this sort of line of work that Iêm currently doing and what weêll be doing is starting another set of studies that looks at these same sort of approaches but sort of modality is going to be a little bit different. I believe instead of group telephone calls it might be video chatting, which creates another interesting dimension to it, but theyêll be going at it through a slightly different approach. So Iêll take notes that youêre sort of interested in continuing on in these sorts of studies, so Iêll take a mental note of that and be sure to let you know once that gets going because right now thatês still in the very preliminary stages. But Iêd just like to than you again for taking the time out of your weeks to help and to call in and Iêm very glad that you were able to get a few things out of it that you were able to incorporate into your daily activities. And the comments that you provided were very very helpful, and theyêre going to be extremely useful going forward and making changes to the study and how things are done within the near future.",7/20/15,B7,56,SUB," Ok, thank you so much for the pleasure.",7/20/15,B7,57,INT," All right (name redacted). It was very nice talking with you. Thank you again for all of your time and effort, and I will keep a lookout for you within the clinic. And if you ever have any questions about anything, whether itês in terms of the mindfulness or any other alternative approaches in the future, you have my e-mail, so just feel free to contact me.",7/20/15,B7,58,SUB, Ok. No problem. Thank you so much.,7/20/15,B7,59,INT," All right (name redacted) thank you so much. Hopefully you have a nice, relaxing, easy weekend.",7/20/15,B7,60,SUB, Thank you. You too.,7/20/15,B7,61,INT, All right. Bye.,7/20/15,B7,62,SUB, All right. Bye.,7/20/15,B39,1,INT, How are you?,8/1/15,C39,2,SUB," Good, how are you?",8/1/15,C39,3,INT," Good, good, yeah. You know, Iêm very happy to hear the good news about your new baby girl. Glad everything worked out well and thank you for sending me the photos. I like the little purple beanie that she had on.",8/1/15,C39,4,SUB," Yes, thank you.",8/1/15,C39,5,INT, So howês everything now then? Have things sort of calmed down a little bit?,8/1/15,C39,6,SUB," Yes, for the most part. Like I was saying, I was getting my dressing changed because I had a C-section and was on the blood thinner, Lovenox?",8/1/15,C39,7,INT, Blood thinner? Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,8,SUB," Yeah. And when they closed me up, I got a hematoma",8/1/15,C39,9,INT, Mm. So thatês not very good. Is it a small one or a big one?,8/1/15,C39,10,SUB," No, it was big. It was all the way across the incision, and the night we were discharged it opened.",8/1/15,C39,11,INT, Ugh.,8/1/15,C39,12,SUB, And so they decided to leave my wound open instead of stitching it closed again.,8/1/15,C39,13,INT, Just so it drains out?,8/1/15,C39,14,SUB," Yeah. So I have the wound (closure device) back on. But it takes all the moisture out, and it will close the incision from the inside out.",8/1/15,C39,15,INT," Yeah, those are interesting little devices that just work with gravity and negative pressure so you donêt really need to do anything to it. You just let it sit there and it does its job. Iêm glad that they were able to get that all fixed up and luckily nothing happened or anything. It sounds like they were able to get things under control relatively quickly.",8/1/15,C39,16,SUB, Yeah. They were.,8/1/15,C39,17,INT," You know, congratulations again on your child. Very, very beautiful. So then just then just sort of wanted to thank you again for your participation within the mindfulness classes. Hopefully you were able to get a few new things out of them. Iêm sure it was probably a very different experience than anything youêve previously tried, at least thatês what Iêve been hearing from other people that Û a little bit off the beaten path but Û",8/1/15,C39,18,SUB," It was very, very helpful though.",8/1/15,C39,19,INT, Mm hm.,8/1/15,C39,20,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,21,INT," Yeah, so thatês pretty much what Iêve been hearing from the other people who have also gone through with that. Itês different but it seems like each person is able to get something out of it that theyêve been able to find useful and implement within their own daily routine, either as a way of managing stress or pain, or something around those lines. So what I wanted to do is I have 10 fairly simple questions just to ask you about your experience in this mindfulness class to help me better understand your perspective on it in terms of what worked and what didnêt work. So thereês no right or wrong answers. Itês just getting your thoughts and perspective on this mindfulness program. So if itês all right with you Iêll walk through the questions _ theyêre all very simple _ just 10 of them, and feel free to give as short of an answer as you want. Or if you want to get more detailed in it, youêre more than welcome to get as detailed as you possibly want to. So does that sound good?",8/1/15,C39,22,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,23,INT," Ok, great. So Iêll just read the questions verbatim. The first one is how easy or difficult it was for you complete the weekly mindfulness classes, either in terms of calling in and the timing of the mindfulness classes.",8/1/15,C39,24,SUB, Besides the circumstances of being in the hospital for a couple of the classes it was easy. The call was ok for me since I donêt work.,8/1/15,C39,25,INT, Because I think it was maybe during the 2nd session you may have called in Û I think it was when you were having a sonogram done. Is that correct?,8/1/15,C39,26,SUB, Um. Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,27,INT," Yeah, I think it was during one of the earlier sessions because I think you had texted me, or I asked you how everything was going and I think you mentioned that you had called in during one of the sessions when you were having a procedure done, which I thought was kind of cool, sort of an example of how if itês done by telephone you donêt need to be physically anywhere in order to participate with this sort of thing.",8/1/15,C39,28,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,29,INT," All right, cool. Yeah. So it sounds like relative easy for you in terms of calling in and stuff like that. So the second question then is sort of a two-part question. What impact, if any, do you feel this mindfulness program had on your perceptions of pain, and your quality of life?",8/1/15,C39,30,SUB," For the quality of life it had a pretty big impact because it was useful for stressful situations. And as far as pain, it helped somewhat because itês also hard to tune out the pain while doing the exercise.",8/1/15,C39,31,INT," So in terms of quality of life, you said it had a larger impact perhaps on that aspect rather than pain. Is there any example that you might be able to provide, or situations, or context of how does your mindfulness program of how youêve been able to use this mindfulness program to improve your quality of life?",8/1/15,C39,32,SUB," I could say when I got frustrated with having to be in and out of the hospital, and being stressed, and I used it in that situation.",8/1/15,C39,33,INT," Ok, sort of like stress related to hospital visits and I guess sort of the larger interactions with healthcare? ",8/1/15,C39,34,SUB, Correct.,8/1/15,C39,35,INT, Ok. Got it. The next question then would be what did you find most useful about this mindfulness program? Is there anything that you found more helpful in comparison Û,8/1/15,C39,36,SUB, Like the breathing exercise?,8/1/15,C39,37,INT, Uh huh. Yeah. I was going to ask if there was any specific exercise that you found most effective.,8/1/15,C39,38,SUB, Yeah. Iêd say the breathing exercise.,8/1/15,C39,39,INT," Ok. So with the breathing exercise, is that the one that you sort of like to do the most?",8/1/15,C39,40,SUB," Yes, that one, and like where youêre lying down and youêre thinking of a happy place and the way you meditate and the sound, the smell, how you feel.",8/1/15,C39,41,INT, So sort of like the body scan exercise?,8/1/15,C39,42,SUB," Yeah, the body scan. Yeah.",8/1/15,C39,43,INT, Got it. Cool. So the breathing exercise and the body scan. So those are two exercises from the program that you found most helpful. Are there any aspects of the class that you didnêt find useful? Or is there anything that you feel might have been over-emphasized that didnêt need as much instruction?,8/1/15,C39,44,SUB, No.,8/1/15,C39,45,INT," Ok. So everything was fairly well-balanced in your opinion, in terms of the practices and exercises?",8/1/15,C39,46,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,47,INT," Ok, great. Letês see. My computer just decided to shut off there. And thatês where I have the questions. I do not have these things memorized. Ok. It looks like it turned back on. Ok, great. So next question is is there any part of the program that you would have wanted more of? Is there any one type of practice or topic that was brought up in one of the mindfulness classes that you feel should have had more emphasis?",8/1/15,C39,48,SUB, I donêt think so.,8/1/15,C39,49,INT, Ok. And I think you already sort of answered this next question is what would you eliminate or have less of in the mindfulness class?,8/1/15,C39,50,SUB, I wouldnêt eliminate anything.,8/1/15,C39,51,INT," All right, perfect. So just three more questions. I know that some of the participants within this class I wasnêt able to provide with audio recordings. Did you get any of the MP3 files, because I think I had sent to you but Iêm not 100% sure. At the beginning of the class, there were some different practice audio tapes, or audio recordings. Did you ever get those?",8/1/15,C39,52,SUB, Iêm not sure. Iêd have to check again. I know I got one.,8/1/15,C39,53,INT," Ok. All right. In terms of practice, did you find yourself being able to practice during the week or did you not have time to practice, or how much emphasis was there on practice for yourself in participating in this class?",8/1/15,C39,54,SUB," I was able to practice because I, of course, used some of the techniques. Itês just a matter of remembering.",8/1/15,C39,55,INT," Mm hm. So when you were practicing on your own, you were just sort of going off of the exercises that were taught during the class, and just trying to replicate those?",8/1/15,C39,56,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,57,INT, Ok. Got it. Was there any type of Û earlier you had mentioned that the two practices or exercises that you found most helpful were the breathing exercise and the body scan exercise. So you obviously practiced those. Do you feel like you practiced those exercises more than the other exercises just because those were easy or did you practice everything equally or try everything?,8/1/15,C39,58,SUB, I tried everything but those were the two that I found most helpful for me.,8/1/15,C39,59,INT, Got it. So those were the two that clicked for you.,8/1/15,C39,60,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,61,INT," Ok. Great. So now that the class is over, do you intend on continuing using the mindfulness techniques?",8/1/15,C39,62,SUB, I do.,8/1/15,C39,63,INT," All right, great. Very last question then, would you recommend a class like this, this mindfulness class, to friends or other patients with sickle cell who also experience pain?",8/1/15,C39,64,SUB," I would, and not just patients just friends who are going through things, stress. I would share the techniques with them.",8/1/15,C39,65,INT," All right, great. So thatês pretty much all of the questions that I had for you in terms of your thoughts and perspectives on the mindfulness class, and then what Iêll do if youêre still looking to keep on practicing or trying to practice the breathing techniques and stuff like that, Iêll send you an e-mail that just has the audio recordings. Just in case you never got those previously, and you still want to listen to have some sort of guide to help you practice in the future, youêll have those for future reference. But other than that though, is there anything else that youêd like to tell me about your participation in this mindfulness class that I might have not talked about in terms of any other thoughts or feelings about it? ",8/1/15,C39,66,SUB," No, I donêt think so.",8/1/15,C39,67,INT," All right, so thatês pretty much it then. There is just a couple of questions I donêt have information from you, which is just sort of like background demographic information that I can just type in a form now, so Iêll do that on my end. Itês just five or six questions. Should take like 30 seconds. Let me just open that up quick and weêll be all finished. So sex, female; age, how old are you?",8/1/15,C39,68,SUB,27,8/1/15,C39,69,INT," 27. Letês see. Do you know your sickle cell genotype whether itês like SS, SC, beta Û",8/1/15,C39,70,SUB, SS,8/1/15,C39,71,INT," SS. Ok. In terms of complications that youêve experienced related to sickle cell, I donêt know how familiar you are with some of the Û Iêm sure youêre more familiar than I am, but in terms of like pulmonary hypertension or hip-knee problems, eyesight stuff Û",8/1/15,C39,72,SUB," AVN, avascular necrosis of the lips Û",8/1/15,C39,73,INT, Have you ever had ,8/1/15,C39,74,SUB, Iêve had two mini-strokes.,8/1/15,C39,75,INT, Ok. Two mini-strokes. Was that as a child then or recently?,8/1/15,C39,76,SUB, As an adult.,8/1/15,C39,77,INT, Ok. And then in terms of experiencing any altered or ocular sight difficulties.,8/1/15,C39,78,SUB, No.,8/1/15,C39,79,INT, Acute chest syndrome?,8/1/15,C39,80,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,81,INT," Ok. So in the last two years, how many emergency department visits related to sickle cell do you think you have probably had?",8/1/15,C39,82,SUB, Past two years? Emergency visits? Maybe eight.,8/1/15,C39,83,INT," Eight, ok. And then out of those eight visits, so sort of a very similar question but slightly different, how many hospitalizations related to sickle cell have you had over the last two years? And this could be counted as, you know, say you were in the emergency department and then from the emergency department you were then transferred to the main hospital as an inpatient.",8/1/15,C39,84,SUB, Iêd say five of those.,8/1/15,C39,85,INT," Ok. Are you being treated for, or have you ever been treated for depression or anxiety?",8/1/15,C39,86,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,87,INT, All right. What is your highest level of education?,8/1/15,C39,88,SUB, Trade school.,8/1/15,C39,89,INT, Ok. Trade school. What was the trade school in?,8/1/15,C39,90,SUB, Phlebotomy.,8/1/15,C39,91,INT," Oh, cool. Thatês definitely different.",8/1/15,C39,92,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,93,INT, Why did you make that choice?,8/1/15,C39,94,SUB," I always found it interesting, ever since I was little when I was going to Duke Pediatrics. There was a phlebotomist that taught me how to draw my own blood.",8/1/15,C39,95,INT," Oh, cool.",8/1/15,C39,96,SUB, She would let me draw my own blood whenever I came but ever since then thatês something I wanted to do.,8/1/15,C39,97,INT," Yeah. I feel that can be extremely stressful job when people have a small, tiny veins.",8/1/15,C39,98,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,99,INT, I feel it can either be really easy or really difficult.,8/1/15,C39,100,SUB," Yeah, and I worked in geriatrics.",8/1/15,C39,101,INT, So itês hard.,8/1/15,C39,102,SUB, So they had old veins.,8/1/15,C39,103,INT," Yeah. Fragile skin and everything, bruise really easily.",8/1/15,C39,104,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,105,INT," All right, so just three more questions. I think youêve already told me this but just wanted to double-check. What is your employment status? Full time, part time, full time school, part time school, or unemployed.",8/1/15,C39,106,SUB, Unemployed.,8/1/15,C39,107,INT, Unemployed. What is your insurance status?,8/1/15,C39,108,SUB, I have Medicaid and Medicare.,8/1/15,C39,109,INT," Ok. And then last question is what is your estimated household income? The categories that I had put were either under $25,000; $25,000 - $50,000; or above $50,000.",8/1/15,C39,110,SUB," Household income, Iêd say (pauses) above $50,000.",8/1/15,C39,111,INT," Ok, great. Yeah, so thatês the very last question then. Thanks for being able to help me out with those demographics and stuff. Itês just so we get a better idea of the range of different types of participants within this mindfulness class. Just sort of helps with when I try to replicate this study or go to a larger group of people, I have an idea of who itês already been tried on and who it hasnêt been tried on yet. So all of that is very helpful. But Iêd just like to thank you again. Thatês pretty much all of the questions that I have for you, so unless you have any questions for me thatês pretty much it. And like I said Iêd sent to you the last check for $50 so that was sent, I think, last Monday / Tuesday, and it usually takes Duke a couple days to process these things, and then send it out through the snail mail, through the USPS. So hopefully you should get it by the end of this week, Friday. If not Friday, Monday. If you donêt get it then, feel free to give me a text message, you know, call, and then Iêll go talk with the financial people and hunt down the check and see whatês happened to it. But otherwise, you got the first check for $10, correct?",8/1/15,C39,112,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,113,INT," Ok, cool. And then I donêt know if I told you or not but I was out of town for the pretty much the whole month of July / August which is why I wasnêt able to send that second check there. So then in order to compensate I figured it was just as easy to throw together the last two payments of $20 and the $30 and so one check to just make it easier, so donêt need to worry about sending a bunch of checks, and itês also cheaper as well because postage still costs quite a bit of money, amazingly.",8/1/15,C39,114,SUB, Right. So your dad is doing ok?,8/1/15,C39,115,INT," No, he ended up passing away. He had two different types of cancer actually. So he was battling that for the last 2-1/2 years and he was on chemo off and on. I think that just sort of tired him out which I think would tire any normal person out. And he was getting older and stuff, so he had an uphill battle. But I was able to see him before he passed away.",8/1/15,C39,116,SUB," Oh, Iêm sorry.",8/1/15,C39,117,INT," Yeah. So it was definitely a difficult time but for as bad as it was, everything works out eventually. It just sort of Û I was glad I was able to get home for a little bit and help out my mom and my little brother and stuff. ",8/1/15,C39,118,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,119,INT," Yeah. It definitely wasnêt a very happy trip to California. Usually when I go back home to California I go over there with a smile on and stuff like that. I still had a smile on, it just wasnêt Û no one really wants to make that sort of trip out.",8/1/15,C39,120,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,121,INT," Thank you for asking though. I guess thatês how things go. He had leukemia and also lymphoma, and the type of leukemia he had was a very rare type where with Û it was a rare lymphoma where you usually Û lymphoma is usually located in the lymph nodes, which is why itês called lymphoma. But his was located inside of his heart which made it pretty difficult to treat, and they werenêt sure what type of treatment they wanted to use and what kind of drugs and all that sort of stuff, so it was kind of a difficult case to manage. But he got Û he still got Û I think from the time he was diagnosed to the time he passed away he had additional 2-1/2 years to live. Otherwise, if he wouldnêt have gotten any treatment he probably would have died 2-1/2 years ago. So Iêm happy he at least got a little extra time and he had a long life, and all that sort of stuff. But thatês the way things go, unfortunately. We all canêt live till weêre 200 years old.",8/1/15,C39,122,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,123,INT, I donêt know if weêd want to live till weêre 200 with the way things are going.,8/1/15,C39,124,SUB, I donêt know if anybody wants to nowadays.,8/1/15,C39,125,INT," Yeah. But thanks again, and Iêll still be around the clinic and stuff like that. I got about another year or so left here over at Duke and Iêll still be working in the clinic Monday through Friday, typically in the mornings, so Iêll look out for you and Iêll definitely catch up with you the next time I see you in the clinics for another clinical appointment. Because youêll still be seeing Û I guess youêll still be seeing an OB/GYN specialist in addition to (name redacted) or Dr. (name redacted) in the next month or so, correct?",8/1/15,C39,126,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,127,INT," Yeah, just for the post-op or Û for the Û",8/1/15,C39,128,SUB," Post-partum, yeah.",8/1/15,C39,129,INT, Follow-up.,8/1/15,C39,130,SUB, Mm hm. Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,131,INT," All right, so thanks again. Donêt want to take up too much of your time here. But it was great meeting with you and talking with you. And I will definitely look forward to seeing you more, and like I said Iêll e-mail you those audio recordings now so if you want to keep on practicing or just to have some sort of audio tapes, so if you ever want to go back and try some of this mindfulness stuff again youêll at least have some material to start with.",8/1/15,C39,132,SUB, Ok.,8/1/15,C39,133,INT," All right, I hope your recovery is very short and everything gets back to normal, and congratulations again with your new little baby girl.",8/1/15,C39,134,SUB, Thank you.,8/1/15,C39,135,INT," All right (name redacted), thank you again.",8/1/15,C39,136,SUB, Ok. You take care.,8/1/15,C39,137,INT, All right thanks. Bye.,8/1/15,C39,138,SUB, Bye bye.,8/1/15,C57,1,INT," Just starting off with a couple of questions, just will be a discussion, just fill in as much as you want or as little as you want. So the first question Iêve got to begin is how easy or difficult was it for you to complete the weekly telephone calls in terms of calling in or arranging around your schedule?",8/15/15,D57,2,SUB, When I was off work of course it was easy but when I was at work I would be rushing to be off by about 3,8/15/15,D57,3,INT," Mm hm. Ok. So disregarding the comment, which weêll get to later, which was how it would have been better to have perhaps in-person sessions, but the feasibility to be able to call in and Ä",8/15/15,D57,4,SUB," Right, that was the (unintelligible) the commitment. Whereas if it was a classroom, I would have been able to say –Hey, I have to go here at 3",8/15/15,D57,5,INT," Ok. Cool. Then specifically with this mindfulness program, do you feel it had any effects or influence on, one, your perceptions of pain and, two, your quality of life?",8/15/15,D57,6,SUB," Yeah. It definitely did. It made me think about what to do when pain comes. Because normally what I would do is just lay there for a while, not really relaxing but not just focusing on the pain instead of focusing on how to eliminate the pain. So it really helped me (unintelligible).",8/15/15,D57,7,INT," Ok, cool. And then outside of the realm of pain, did you find it helpful for anything else?",8/15/15,D57,8,SUB," Yes. Extremely. When I get frustrated, mad, sit down and think about it. I think about the situation, how could things be different, why is the other person acting like this? And stuff like that. And that really helps me in my mind on that matter.",8/15/15,D57,9,INT, So really just slowing down and being aware of whatês going on and why itês going on.,8/15/15,D57,10,SUB, Thinking about other people instead of being selfish about certain situations.,8/15/15,D57,11,INT, Got it. So out of the Ä so I think you attended about four out of six of the sessions Ä what did you find most helpful?,8/15/15,D57,12,SUB, I donêt know what itês called but she told us to close our eyes and feel the blood flowing through our veins Ä,8/15/15,D57,13,INT, The body scan exercise maybe?,8/15/15,D57,14,SUB," Right. Right. And that really helped me. And she was like –If youêre having pain, focus on that one area and let the blood flow into that area” and it really helped me.",8/15/15,D57,15,INT, So sort of the visualization aspects of it.,8/15/15,D57,16,SUB, I think I missed the one about food.,8/15/15,D57,17,INT, Ok. Yeah. Might have been.,8/15/15,D57,18,SUB, Yeah. I missed that one but all the other ones I got were good.,8/15/15,D57,19,INT," Ok, cool. So sort of the opposite question then, was there anything in the program, in the classes, that you feel werenêt that helpful or donêt need as much focus?",8/15/15,D57,20,SUB," No, not really because what works for me might not work for someone else. You know what Iêm saying? Like Ä I mean, what helps me might not help you, and vice versa. So I canêt really say that anything needs to be taken away.",8/15/15,D57,21,INT, So letês say like for you personally. So were there any exercises that didnêt really resonate well with your own style?,8/15/15,D57,22,SUB," Not really. Not really. But I felt like all of them were like good as far as getting you to think about pain, like pain management. I found that sometimes it worked better than a prescription for pain. So it was good to me.",8/15/15,D57,23,INT," Interesting. So very different type of, I guess, relationship with the pain experience now perhaps?",8/15/15,D57,24,SUB," Right, right.",8/15/15,D57,25,INT, I can imagine it sort of varies depending on the type and the degree and the duration of the pain that you might be experiencing.,8/15/15,D57,26,SUB," Right, right, right, right.",8/15/15,D57,27,INT," So in going down that sort of path, what sort of painful situations have you found yourself applying these techniques, and can you provide me with an example?",8/15/15,D57,28,SUB, You mean as far as like sickle cell pain?,8/15/15,D57,29,INT, Yeah. You know Ä,8/15/15,D57,30,SUB, Really I havenêt had to apply them to any sickle cell pain because I havenêt really had any.,8/15/15,D57,31,INT, Everythingês been good. Yeah.,8/15/15,D57,32,SUB," So far. I mean. Iêve had a headache, like a sinus headache or whatever, but I really havenêt had any pain.",8/15/15,D57,33,INT," Ok, cool. So since the class has ended, have you tried to practice any of the exercises or Ä",8/15/15,D57,34,SUB, Every day. Every day. I donêt have sickle cell pain that often. Like Iêll find myself thinking about things sheês said and how I can apply them to my life and make a better me.,8/15/15,D57,35,INT, Just all the other every day stress relief?,8/15/15,D57,36,SUB, Exactly.,8/15/15,D57,37,INT," Youêve got pain, and then have all the other types of pain related to living.",8/15/15,D57,38,SUB, Yep.,8/15/15,D57,39,INT, So I think you sort of talked about this a little bit but how easy or difficult was it for you to practice the exercises on your own that you learned during the class sessions?,8/15/15,D57,40,SUB," At first I had to eliminate everyone around me because sometimes my nephew comes over to my house and all that, and heês noisy and all that. I just had to take a step back and think about getting alone to myself, like it requires you Ä these exercises require you to be alone so you can get relaxed, so thatês what I did.",8/15/15,D57,41,INT, So for you it was about getting into a nice quiet space.,8/15/15,D57,42,SUB, Right.,8/15/15,D57,43,INT, Ok. Cool. So it was really just trying to get into an area where then you could concentrate and focus on the exercise and not have any type of distractions from your nephew or family.,8/15/15,D57,44,SUB, Right. Exactly.,8/15/15,D57,45,INT," And once you had the distractions away, then youêd be able to easily practice?",8/15/15,D57,46,SUB, Mm hm. (yes),8/15/15,D57,47,INT, Ok. Cool. So sort of like one of the final questions then is would you recommend this mindfulness class to someone with sickle cell or to another friend?,8/15/15,D57,48,SUB, Definitely. Iêd recommend this to regular people without any kind of disease because it really helps with any pain really.,8/15/15,D57,49,INT," Yeah, I definitely think youêre 100% right there. Itês actually easier as well to acquire this sort of skill when youêre healthy than when youêre sick and having a painful sort of crisis that, you know, when youêre in pain the last thing you want to do is learn some new coping mechanism when youêre in excruciating pain. All you want to do is focus on nothing then, right? Or the polar opposite of what pain is.",8/15/15,D57,50,SUB, Pretty much.,8/15/15,D57,51,INT," Yeah. So sort of Ä that is something I was thinking might be a potential barrier, depending on the degree and the amount of pain that the participants in this type of mindfulness program are experiencing at that particular time. It might potentially influence how well or how not well they might be able to learn whatês being taught in the classes and then applied to their own lives. But it sounds like, at least for your case, it turned out fairly well. Youêre able to learn some new things and incorporate it into your daily schedule.",8/15/15,D57,52,SUB, Right. Right. It was definitely good for me.,8/15/15,D57,53,INT," So one thing that Iêve been thinking about _ and Iêd be interesting in getting your thoughts on this _ so I donêt remember too much of your chart from the last time I was looking at it, but in terms of how frequently you have pain crises, are they fairly frequent or not that frequent?",8/15/15,D57,54,SUB, It all depends on the time of the year.,8/15/15,D57,55,INT, It was like one to two a year for you?,8/15/15,D57,56,SUB," No, itês more than that. More like Ä two times a year. Three. Maybe. When it gets cold outside.",8/15/15,D57,57,INT," So is there any sort of transition period between fall, winter Ä",8/15/15,D57,58,SUB, It usually happens like in winter.,8/15/15,D57,59,INT," Oh, ok.",8/15/15,D57,60,SUB," So like late December, early January, February. Usually happens. But then when springtime comes around, things start to blossom and stuff it typically dies down.",8/15/15,D57,61,INT," Yeah, so, the reason I was asking that question, something I have heard from other patients and would be interested in getting your thoughts on this, was for some people the Ä what Iêve heard is the most Ä the thing theyêve been able to get out of it is more for bodily awareness, in terms of being able to sense things, perhaps, earlier, so Iêve heard a lot about this issue where thereês a plateau or a certain peak where once your pain gets above that threshold youêve got to go to the ED or to see your doctor.",8/15/15,D57,62,SUB, Right.,8/15/15,D57,63,INT," Or whatever medications you do, or what you try and change, nothing is really going to help the pain. So what Iêve heard from a few people is that theyêve been able to become more aware and further, through preemptively notice signs potentially of an incoming crisis, just by being more aware of the bodily sensations and being able to focus on the presence of the current moments. So I was wondering if you had that similar experience. But you havenêt really had any pain crises in the past couple of months it seems like, correct, since participating in the study?",8/15/15,D57,64,SUB," Correct. Right. I definitely notice it. So what I do, is like if I feel a pain crisis coming on, if itês like February, and I feel pain coming, I go ahead and take the pills, but now I have this resource that I can use so I would take the pills and then I would try to do this. And then when the pain got to a certain level thatês when I would have to go to the emergency room.",8/15/15,D57,65,INT," Cool. So now the plan is to implement this as your Ä like an addition to the pain meds. Just another type of tool in the shed, or whatever analogy or metaphor you want to use.",8/15/15,D57,66,SUB, Right.,8/15/15,D57,67,INT," Ok, cool. It seems like thatês what Iêve been hearing more so now is that with this Ä might not necessarily decrease the physical sensation of pain but at least make you more aware of pain crises, and then being able to change your behavior whether itês drinking more water or finding a quiet environment or whatever more preemptively to avoid the pain sort of spiking and going up so at that point itês no longer really manageable on your own. So instead of maybe this mindfulness decreasing pain, it at least it allows you not to have the pain increase any further than what it already is. It might sort of allow you to make these sort of behavioral changes or physical changes to your environment or eating the food, whatever it might be.",8/15/15,D57,68,SUB," Usually I can tell what itês going to lead to, and if it comes like numb and all that I know I need to go to the ER. But if itês just like a throbbing pain, it usually goes away. ",8/15/15,D57,69,INT," In terms of like the spans of this sort of sensation of this feeling of being able to potentially predict whether itês going to go away or turn into a crisis, how long a period can you usually Ä",8/15/15,D57,70,SUB, Like an hour.,8/15/15,D57,71,INT, An hour or so? ,8/15/15,D57,72,SUB, Yes.,8/15/15,D57,73,INT," Ok, so itês relatively a short period. So itês not like a couple hours and then it slowly progresses over a day or two days",8/15/15,D57,74,SUB," Mm hm. But when I get it, I got admitted one time, and it had got to that level that I had to come to the ER, and it wasnêt like a day or two days before like it had been, but after I got admitted it was still hurting the next few days. So I didnêt know before but I definitely felt it after.",8/15/15,D57,75,INT," So thereês definitely some variability in that experience, I guess. But in terms of noticing it before it begins, itês a relatively short period.",8/15/15,D57,76,SUB, Mm hm.,8/15/15,D57,77,INT, Ok. Cool.,8/15/15,D57,78,SUB," I mean, for me.",8/15/15,D57,79,INT," Oh yeah. It definitely seems like it differs in people. In some people it might be a day or two. Some itês like 10-15 minutes, and then itês full-blown crisis.",8/15/15,D57,80,SUB," Right, right.",8/15/15,D57,81,INT, Well thatês pretty much all of the questions that I had for you. If you had any other questions for myself about the study Ä,8/15/15,D60,1,INT," Thanks for being able to take a couple minutes of your time. Itês fairly brief and stuff like that. I just wanted to thank you again for being able to call in to the mindfulness classes, and hopefully you were able to get a few things out of it that you previously werenêt aware of and Iêm sure it was overall just a different experience than anything youêve probably tried previously. So like I said, thank you again for your participation, and also so you got the check sent to you in the mail for $50. That was sent to Duke last week and it takes a couple days to process and mail out, so hopefully you should get that check by the end of this week. Just keep me up-to-date. If you donêt get it by, say, Friday, Iêll be able to call and find out whatês going on with it there.",9/1/15,E60,2,SUB, Ok.,9/1/15,E60,3,INT," So Iêve just got 10 very simple, basic questions for you regarding mindfulness to help me get a better idea of what sort of worked and what didnêt work and stuff like that. The first question is Ä Iêll just sort of walk through them and you can just give me a brief answer or as detailed as you want. Thereês not really any sort of set-up to it. The first question is if youêd be able to tell me how easy or how difficult it was for you to call in to these mindfulness sessions.",9/1/15,E60,4,SUB, Can you hear me now? I had it on mute. It wasnêt that difficult. ,9/1/15,E60,5,INT, Ok. So in terms of the timing of the sessions and stuff like that Ä,9/1/15,E60,6,SUB," Well the timing was off because I was at work when I had to call, so thatês why I forgot about it.",9/1/15,E60,7,INT," Oh yeah. You were calling in during your work hours, right?",9/1/15,E60,8,SUB," Right. Right. But when I got home I tried to, but sometimes I got home late and be able to sleep.",9/1/15,E60,9,INT, And did that sort of help? Did you find that useful to help you go to sleep?,9/1/15,E60,10,SUB," Yes, I did.",9/1/15,E60,11,INT," Yeah. So other than sleep, did this mindfulness program have an effect on your perceptions of pain, of the physically chronic pain?",9/1/15,E60,12,SUB," A little bit, Iêd say. Not much.",9/1/15,E60,13,INT, Ok. So a little bit but not too much.,9/1/15,E60,14,SUB, Uh huh.,9/1/15,E60,15,INT," And so outside of chronic pain, how about sort of larger quality of life Ä so quality of life meaning like your daily activities, you know, getting up or going to work Ä",9/1/15,E60,16,SUB, It helped me relax more.,9/1/15,E60,17,INT, So what would be an example of how it helped you relax more?,9/1/15,E60,18,SUB," It never did (unintelligible) as quickly. Just keep calm, and breathe easily, relax.",9/1/15,E60,19,INT," So like Ä would it help you relax while youêd be at work, or dealing with something at home sort of situation, or sort of in what context in terms of the Ä can you think of any specific situation or was it more sort of broad?",9/1/15,E60,20,SUB," Broad, everyday living.",9/1/15,E60,21,INT, Ok.,9/1/15,E60,22,SUB, Yeah. ,9/1/15,E60,23,INT," Ok. So with this mindfulness class, what did you find most useful about it?",9/1/15,E60,24,SUB," Like I said, more the relaxation than the pain. It did help to ease the pain some, you know? Take your mind off the pain.",9/1/15,E60,25,INT," And then how about what do you think was the least useful aspect of this mindfulness class? Like what do you feel you didnêt really get out of it, or was there any sort of exercise in particular that you feel wasnêt that useful?",9/1/15,E60,26,SUB," Everything was useful, you know, get that quality time to do it while I was at work, while she was talking through it. I was telling her I need the CD. I never did get the CD in my package.",9/1/15,E60,27,INT," Ok, yeah, my bad about that. What Iêll do though is Iêm going to take a note of that now. If you want I can still send that to you.",9/1/15,E60,28,SUB," Yeah, send that to me.",9/1/15,E60,29,INT," Yeah, so you can still listen through it. ",9/1/15,E60,30,SUB," Right, right.",9/1/15,E60,31,INT," So actually I have your e-mail have your e-mail here. So if you want I can either send you a digital copy so itês just a couple of MP3 files that I could send to your e-mail, or I could send you a physical sort of CD disc copy. Do you have any sort of preference?",9/1/15,E60,32,SUB, You can send it to my e-mail.,9/1/15,E60,33,INT," Ok, great. Yeah. What Iêll do then is once weêre done talking, I believe itês like 5 or 6 small little MP3 files Ä",9/1/15,E60,34,SUB, What e-mail do you have for me?,9/1/15,E60,35,INT, The one I got is (redacted),9/1/15,E60,36,SUB," Yeah, thatês it. Yeah.",9/1/15,E60,37,INT," Yeah, I got (redacted). Correct?",9/1/15,E60,38,SUB, Yes. ,9/1/15,E60,39,INT," Ok, cool, yeah. Bad one me in terms of you not having that. But Iêll send those to you and you can listen through them and that might be some sort of way of keeping up with some of the practices that you find more useful.",9/1/15,E60,40,SUB," Yeah, Iêd like to.",9/1/15,E60,41,INT," Cool. All right, so is there any part of this mindfulness class that you would have liked to have more experience with or more interaction with?",9/1/15,E60,42,SUB," Not really. Probably one part of it. See, like I said by me being on the road at the time of the conference call I couldnêt give my full attention to it but I would like the CD part so I could go back and listen to it during my regular hours. I can listen to it and think about things. I liked the class though. I liked it though.",9/1/15,E60,43,INT," All right, just in terms of having that extra sort of homework material, or sort of practice tapes.",9/1/15,E60,44,SUB, Yeah. Yes.,9/1/15,E60,45,INT, Ok. Next question. I think youêve already sort of answered it but is there anything that you  would eliminate or have less of in the mindfulness class?,9/1/15,E60,46,SUB," No, itês not. No.",9/1/15,E60,47,INT," Ok. Letês see. Next question youêve already answered as well but Iêll still ask it. Thereês only two more questions. Tell me about how easy or difficult it was for you to practice mindfulness and complete the homework assignments. So it just seems like difficulty there but that was just due to my own error and not being able to get you those practice tapes. Otherwise, you probably would have liked to have listened to them on that weekly basis.",9/1/15,E60,48,SUB, Yes.,9/1/15,E60,49,INT, Do you continue on using the mindfulness practices that you learned during this program?,9/1/15,E60,50,SUB," Yes, I am. Yes.",9/1/15,E60,51,INT," Ok, so in what sort of context do you plan on using them? Stress reduction or during work and stuff like that?",9/1/15,E60,52,SUB, Stress reduction.,9/1/15,E60,53,INT, Mm hm. All right. And then would you recommend this mindfulness class either to other patients with sickle cell that are experiencing chronic pain Ä,9/1/15,E60,54,SUB," Yes, I would.",9/1/15,E60,55,INT," All right. Ok, great. Yeah. So that was pretty much the little brief questions. Is there anything else youêd like to tell me about your experience within this mindfulness class that I might have not covered? Any concerns or questions?",9/1/15,E60,56,SUB, Theyêre covered.,9/1/15,E60,57,INT," Ok, cool. So then I just have 3 _ 4 questions in terms of your demographic information that I never collected earlier. These are all extremely simple. This will probably take 30 seconds for me to ask you. I already have about half of them. ",9/1/15,E60,58,SUB, Ok.,9/1/15,E60,59,INT, Youêre male. Whatês your age?,9/1/15,E60,60,SUB,48,9/1/15,E60,61,INT," 48. And the type of Ä do you know your type of sickle cell genotype, whether itês SS, SC, beta?",9/1/15,E60,62,SUB, The SC.,9/1/15,E60,63,INT," All right. So have you had any major complications related to sickle cell such as any problems with your kidneys, liver, hypertension, stroke?",9/1/15,E60,64,SUB, None.,9/1/15,E60,65,INT, Any problems seeing?,9/1/15,E60,66,SUB, Any what?,9/1/15,E60,67,INT," Sorry, so the last question was any problems seeing, like your eyes, any sort of eye problems?",9/1/15,E60,68,SUB, I had one eye problem a long time ago.,9/1/15,E60,69,INT," Ok. And how about anything in terms of like hips, shoulders, any sort of knee/joint issues? ",9/1/15,E60,70,INT, Sorry? It sounds like Ä were you able to catch that?,9/1/15,E60,71,SUB, Iêm back.,9/1/15,E60,72,INT, Ok. Cool. It sounded like you just dropped out.,9/1/15,E60,73,SUB, Yeah.,9/1/15,E60,74,INT," Just a couple of last questions. In terms of the last year, have you had any ED visits?",9/1/15,E60,75,SUB, Who?,9/1/15,E60,76,INT," Over the last two years, have you had any ED visits related to sickle cell?",9/1/15,E60,77,SUB, Whatês that? E what?,9/1/15,E60,78,INT, Oh. So have you gone to the emergency room for any sickle cell related stuff for the last two years?,9/1/15,E60,79,SUB, Sickle cell related?,9/1/15,E60,80,INT," Correct. So the question on the form reads –Provide a number between 0 and 100, of applicable, of how many times youêve gone to the emergency department in the last 2 years for sickle cell.”",9/1/15,E60,81,SUB, Probably 2 or 3 times.,9/1/15,E60,82,INT," Ok. So 2 or 3 times. Letês see. All right. And then your employment status options are full time, part time, full time school, part time school, or unemployed. Youêre full time or part time, right?",9/1/15,E60,83,SUB," Part time, disability, yes.",9/1/15,E60,84,INT, Ok. Part time. And then last question is insurance status. What sort of insurance carrier do you currently have?,9/1/15,E60,85,SUB, (phone breaks up),9/1/15,E60,86,INT, Sorry what was that?,9/1/15,E60,87,SUB, Medicaid.,9/1/15,E60,88,INT," Ok. Got it. Got it. Thatês pretty much it then. So what Iêll do then is Iêll send you those MP3 files, those practice tapes to your e-mail now, and just let me know if you have any questions about them or if you want any sort of additional content within the next couple of weeks, if you get tired of listening to those because Iêve got a bunch of other stuff. So just let me know if you have any questions, and thanks again for being able to call in, and I hope everything works out. Just thanks again and let me know if you donêt get that $50 check in the mail by the end of the week.",9/1/15,E60,89,SUB, I will.,9/1/15,E60,90,INT," All right, cool. Thank you again, and have a safe drive home.",9/1/15,E60,91,SUB, Ok.,9/1/15,E60,92,INT, All right (name redacted). Thanks again.,9/1/15,E60,93,SUB," All right, thank you.",9/1/15,E60,94,INT, All right. Bye.,9/1/15,E86,1,INT," Hey, how are you?",9/25/15,F86,2,SUB," Iêm well, how are you?",9/25/15,F86,3,INT," Good, good, thanks. How was your Christmas and holidays and all that sort of stuff?",9/25/15,F86,4,SUB," Um, it was pretty good. It was a little different but it was pretty good.",9/25/15,F86,5,INT, Oh good. Well hopefully you were still able to relax and recharge the batteries a little bit.,9/25/15,F86,6,SUB, Yes. And how was your Christmas and holiday?,9/25/15,F86,7,INT," Yeah, it was good. Ended up going back home and seeing my family in California. Unfortunately it was just about as cold there as it was here though. Usually I like to go over there to try and get a little bit of heat in and warmer weather but unfortunately it was also cold and raining, and our heater ended up breaking as well.",9/25/15,F86,8,SUB, Oh wow.,9/25/15,F86,9,INT," Yeah. But other than that, though, it was definitely nice. You know, I was able to relax a little bit and refocus my energy which is always nice. ",9/25/15,F86,10,SUB, Mm hm.,9/25/15,F86,11,INT," But I wonêt try to take too much of your time here. Thanks again for all of your work and for helping out with the study. Weêre at the point now where weêve collected all of the information, have run all of the different mindfulness sessions for 60 patients total, so now weêre going to be starting to analyze some of the data and find out what actually happened and how effective or not effective this type of program actually is for sickle cell. And part of that, then, is talking with each of the individuals that participated just briefly about what you liked and what you didnêt like. So what Iêll do is just sort of walk through 10 very brief questions. Theyêre open-ended questions. There are no right or wrong answers. Itês just to get a better sense of your perceptions about what you liked and what you didnêt like and what you feel helped or didnêt help. So does that makes sense?",9/25/15,F86,12,SUB," Yes, uh huh. It does.",9/25/15,F86,13,INT," Ok, great. So the very first question is if you could just tell me how easy or how difficult it was for you to complete the weekly telephone sessions.",9/25/15,F86,14,SUB, You say how easy or difficult?,9/25/15,F86,15,INT," Yeah, so in terms of like was it hard trying to call in each week or sort of a regular time or was that fairly easy for you to work in your schedule?",9/25/15,F86,16,SUB, It was fairly easy because it was after Ä around 3,9/25/15,F86,17,INT," Great. So you thought that was sort of a valuable addition there, just sort of having some sort of reminder. And do you think having it a half hour or an hour before, or what do you think is like an ideal amount of time?",9/25/15,F86,18,SUB, Maybe an hour before.,9/25/15,F86,19,INT," Ok. Ok. Great. So second question is what impact, if any, do you feel this program had on your perceptions of pain?",9/25/15,F86,20,SUB," I think that it changed my perspective because a lot of times when I am in pain I am totally focused on that pain, so this helped me do exercises where Iêm not just focused on my pain. I can kind of work through it a little bit and do other things besides just focus on the pain.",9/25/15,F86,21,INT," So what might a Ä ok, sorry.",9/25/15,F86,22,SUB," Ok, thatês it. Thatês it, Iêm sorry.",9/25/15,F86,23,INT, Ok. So I was going to ask would you be able provide an example with what you described there. It sounds like the mindfulness was able to help you refocus your energy away from the pain and onto something else so that pain wasnêt as distracting. So is that more for like acute pain or chronic pain Ä I guess that would be the first question.,9/25/15,F86,24,SUB, Maybe the Ä I want to say the acute pain. I donêt know about that because I think it would help some but I think maybe for the mild pain but maybe if it got worse after that I think that it would help a little bit with not focusing on it as much but I think there would be other alternatives that you have to go with. But I think it would help some but it wouldnêt be like a Ä I guess a Ä it wouldnêt totally make the pain go away is what Iêm trying to say. You know what Iêm saying?,9/25/15,F86,25,INT," Yeah, just by refocusing your energy it wouldnêt bring your pain down from a seven to like a zero, right?",9/25/15,F86,26,SUB," Right, right. It would help, but it wouldnêt bring it all the way down to a zero. It would make it more tolerable I guess, in a way.",9/25/15,F86,27,INT," Ok. So one other type of pain I want to ask about is vaso-occlusive crises. During the duration of this program or after, did you experience any VOCs?",9/25/15,F86,28,SUB, Any what now?,9/25/15,F86,29,INT, Any sort of pain crises? Any vas-occlusive crises?,9/25/15,F86,30,SUB," Mm mm. No, I didnêt. Not after doing that. No.",9/25/15,F86,31,INT," Ok, great. So the second part of this question _ the first part was if mindfulness had any effect on your perceptions of pain, and the second part is on your quality of life. So do you think it sort of improved any parts of your life or maybe not improved any parts of your life?",9/25/15,F86,32,SUB," I think it improved. It helped me to I guess focus more on other things around me except for not just dwelling on the pain. I think itês something I could help other people with that maybe donêt have sickle cell but have some type of other types of pain maybe. You know, those things. So I think that it would help me with my relationships as well for Ä to just help other people I guess.",9/25/15,F86,33,INT," Ok, so you were able to sort of see other applications to it that helped improve your life other than pain.",9/25/15,F86,34,SUB, Right. Right.,9/25/15,F86,35,INT," Ok. Cool. Next question is what did you find most useful about this mindfulness program? And that could have been a particular type of class or lesson learned, or it could just be, for example, talking with other individuals also with sickle cell for the duration of the six-week pogram.",9/25/15,F86,36,SUB," Yes, I think being able to talk to other people who had sickle cell anemia and listen to their experiences. Also I liked the mindful eating. I really enjoyed that one.",9/25/15,F86,37,INT," Oh yeah. It was with the raisins, right?",9/25/15,F86,38,SUB, Right. Raisins. Uh huh.,9/25/15,F86,39,INT," Yeah, thatês a very different experience. Normally, I know I still have trouble whenever we eating, we just plow through everything and it could be a lot more of a peaceful process than just slamming food down our throats, right?",9/25/15,F86,40,SUB," Right. And then sometimes with the medicine you canêt really eat. You just really donêt have a major appetite sometimes. But I think just with mindful eating, maybe that could help, if you just eat just a little Ä try to eat just a little bit and just do the exercise it may be a little bit better, because sometimes when I have the medicine in my system, like morphine and dilaudid, I really donêt eat anything at all. But maybe learning that technique I would be able to eat something small and just kind of take my time with it and maybe that would be better than me thinking that I have to rush through it and eat all of it. You know. And that just turns me off.",9/25/15,F86,41,INT," So that was one example of how you found that to be useful. I just try to repeat what you said to make sure I understand and Iêm not misinterpreting. So the mindful eating is an example of a part of the lesson that you enjoyed because youêre able to apply it when youêre taking medications that made it difficult for you to eat. And then, the mindful eating exercise, you were able to apply that to eat a small amount of food which _ from how you say it _ is better than not eating. Correct?",9/25/15,F86,42,SUB, Right. Right.,9/25/15,F86,43,INT, Ok. Cool.,9/25/15,F86,44,SUB," Because I go a few days without really eating anything. If Iêm in a lot of pain I will probably Ä and with that medication, it suppresses my appetite, you know. So if I could probably just eat a little bit then maybe that will be better than, like you said, not eating anything. ",9/25/15,F86,45,INT, So do you think that was the type of mindfulness that you practiced the most then?,9/25/15,F86,46,SUB," Yes, I think so. (unintelligible; over-talking)",9/25/15,F86,47,INT," Ok, great. The opposite question then is what did you find least useful about this mindfulness program?",9/25/15,F86,48,SUB, I really didnêt find anything that was not really useful. I mean I thought it was a lot of great techniques. So I really didnêt find anything that was not really useful.,9/25/15,F86,49,INT," Ok, great. So you were able to sort of find some relevance within each of the different lessons.",9/25/15,F86,50,SUB, Right. Right.,9/25/15,F86,51,INT, Ok. So is there anything that you would want more of in this mindfulness program? Anything that you feel should have more emphasis?,9/25/15,F86,52,SUB," I think it was a pretty good balance of all the different exercises and everything. I think (unintelligible, over-talking). It was very relaxing, Iêll tell you that.",9/25/15,F86,53,INT," Good. So, for example, the amount of time. It was about 60 minutes. Do you feel it could be longer or shorter, for example? Or do you feel it was the right time, or maybe how the class was structured? It was sort of structured Ä we tried to have the first half of the class be a sort of review and instruction and the second half of the class more focused on an actual practice.",9/25/15,F86,54,SUB, I think that was fine. I think it was the right amount of time to do both the review and to do the next session. So I think that was a good amount of time.,9/25/15,F86,55,INT, Ok. Great. So then the opposite to that question then is do you feel thereês anything that should be eliminated or maybe not eliminated but less emphasized within the mindfulness program?,9/25/15,F86,56,SUB," No, I think everything had good balance, and I really enjoyed it because it was enough where everybody could communicate with one another. They could express their ideas and how they would use them. So I think it was a good balance of everything. I donêt think it was too much or too less. I think it was a pretty good balance.",9/25/15,F86,57,INT, Ok. Great. So just three more questions then. How difficult or easy was it for you to practice the mindfulness lessons outside of the one-hour weekly time slot?,9/25/15,F86,58,SUB," I felt like it was kind of easy to do it at home, or sometimes if I had a little break and I may be experiencing some pain or something like that I would maybe be able to think of one of the drills or something like that, one of the practices and maybe apply it. I thought it was kind of easy even though I wasnêt going through something like a major crisis. You know, it wasnêt like a crisis that would have sent me to the hospital or anything like that. So it was probably used on something like real minor pain. So I felt like it was fairly easy to practice those things.",9/25/15,F86,59,INT," Ok. So like with your work schedule and your weekly life schedule, did you find that there were any certain times of the day that you found it easier to practice, or did you set up any schedule where youêd try and practice a couple minutes a day or every other day?",9/25/15,F86,60,SUB," I probably practiced at least a couple times a week. Normally when I was at work, after my students left and I just had the room to myself, or I was on planning period or something like that, I could really try to relax and come down from, you know, the stress of the job, you know. ",9/25/15,F86,61,INT," Dealing with a bunch of kids, right? So now that the mindfulness class has finished, do you intend to continue using what you have learned from this mindfulness class or this mindfulness program?",9/25/15,F86,62,SUB," Yes. Yes, I do.",9/25/15,F86,63,INT, Ok. And I think youêve already answered this question but would you recommend mindfulness to friends with sickle cell who also experience pain?,9/25/15,F86,64,SUB," Yes, I would.",9/25/15,F86,65,INT," Ok. And then so that was pretty much it. The very last question is just if thereês anything else youêd like me to know about your experience that I might have not touched on, you know, any ways that you found the mindfulness program helpful to a certain type of symptom, or if you had any ideas about how it could be potentially better it would be great to get any sort of feedback. Or if you donêt have anything else, thatês also fine as well.",9/25/15,F86,66,SUB," I think thatês really it. I just really enjoyed being able to listen to other peopleês experiences and know that Iêm not really alone, that theyêre going Ä even though I know, of course, thereês other people that have sickle cell anemia like I do, I know that, but sometimes to be able to hear the things that other sicklers are going through, you know, and itês like youêre not alone, and there are ways to kind of deal with it.",9/25/15,F86,67,INT," So definitely having the group structure, sounds like you were a big fan of having this type of mindfulness program not being individual but having it being a more social type of experience.",9/25/15,F86,68,SUB, Right. Right.,9/25/15,F86,69,INT," Ideally how we had set up the program was that there could have been hypothetically 10 patients on every call but for obvious reasons not everyone is always able to call in and some people dropped out, or busy, or so on. I think within your group there might have been an average of somewhere between three to five callers for each of the classes. Do you feel like that was a fairly good number? Do you think it would have been manageable with more callers, say like closer to like 10, or do you feel having the smaller group of three to five people is more ideal?",9/25/15,F86,70,SUB," I say maybe not three. I say at least five, maybe six. But not less than Ä probably not more than five or six. That way everybody gets to speak and youêre not rude talking over each other. You know, I thought that was a pretty good number.",9/25/15,F86,71,INT, Mm hm. Because you feel like with this smaller number if it were just to be like just three people you might feel more pressured to say things if youêre not really comfortable saying something?,9/25/15,F86,72,SUB, Mm hm. Mm hm.,9/25/15,F86,73,INT," Ok, got it. All right, thatês pretty much all of the questions that I had. Theyêre fairly quick and short and stuff like that. So, you know, thanks again for all of the work and being able to call in to those sessions and letês see. So what Iêll do is Iêll just give you a call or a text to check in within two weeks to make sure that youêve gotten that final paycheck. I know sometimes Duke is sort of slow with things but they do usually come. Itês just a question of when. So it will be a check for $50. And letês see Ä I was going to check my little spreadsheet quick to make sure I got everything else from you. So Ä I donêt know if you had filled out Ä I got the other questionnaires Ä but a demographics questionnaire?",9/25/15,F86,74,SUB, I donêt think so.,9/25/15,F86,75,INT," Ok. So what I could do, thatês just a simple multiple choice questionnaire. If you have like 60 more seconds I could just do it over the phone with you and then Iêll just fill in the responses if that works.",9/25/15,F86,76,SUB, Ok.,9/25/15,F86,77,INT," Ok, great. Let me open it up. I forgot. Youêre a middle school or a high school teacher?",9/25/15,F86,78,SUB, Middle school.,9/25/15,F86,79,INT," Middle school. Ok. Youêre able to get away from the kids for about four weeks or so I guess, right?",9/25/15,F86,80,SUB," Four at a time, yes.",9/25/15,F86,81,INT," Yeah, that used to be my favorite time of the school year. Winter break. (talking to self, looking for questionnaire) Ok, your age?",9/25/15,F86,82,SUB, Iêm 34.,9/25/15,F86,83,INT," Youêre non-hispanic, correct?",9/25/15,F86,84,SUB, Right.,9/25/15,F86,85,INT," African-American, sickle cell genotype. (Reads genotype selections)",9/25/15,F86,86,SUB, SS,9/25/15,F86,87,INT," So have you had any major complications related to sickle cell? Examples might be pulmonary hypertension, avascular necrosis, acute chest syndrome, ocular disease, kidney function, or stroke?",9/25/15,F86,88,SUB, Iêve had some of the acute chest pains. Iêve also lost my spleen and my gall bladder. You know. But thatês really it.,9/25/15,F86,89,INT," Ok. So over the last two years, how many ED visits do you think youêve had related to sickle cell?",9/25/15,F86,90,SUB, Maybe four? Three or four.,9/25/15,F86,91,INT," Ok. And along the same lines, how many hospitalizations related to sickle cell in the last two years do you think that youêve had?",9/25/15,F86,92,SUB," Normally when I go to the ER, more than likely Iêm going to be hospitalized. So I probably say three or four. You know.",9/25/15,F86,93,INT," Ok. So most of the time when you go to the ED, thatês going to transfer over to a hospital admit then.",9/25/15,F86,94,SUB, Mm hm. Yes.,9/25/15,F86,95,INT," Ok. Three more questions. Are you being treated for, or have you been told you should be treated for, depression or anxiety?",9/25/15,F86,96,SUB, yes.,9/25/15,F86,97,INT, What is your highest level of education completed?,9/25/15,F86,98,SUB, College level.,9/25/15,F86,99,INT, Ok. And thatês Bachelorês?,9/25/15,F86,100,SUB," Mm hm. And some Masterês but thatês incomplete, so just Bachelorês.",9/25/15,F86,101,INT," Ok. Your employment status, full time, part time, full time school, part time school, or unemployed.",9/25/15,F86,102,SUB, Full time teacher. Full time.,9/25/15,F86,103,INT," Ok. And what is your insurance status? So it could be the options are Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, VA, no insurance, or other type of insurance.",9/25/15,F86,104,SUB, I have insurance through my job. I guess other. Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Private? I donêt know.,9/25/15,F86,105,INT," Yeah. I think Blue Shield would fall under private insurance then. And then the last question is what is your estimated household income? The categories are under $25,000; $25,000 - $50,000; $50,000 - $75,000; or above $75,000.",9/25/15,F86,106,SUB," $25,000 - $50,000",9/25/15,F86,107,INT," Ok. Great. So let me make sure I got everything. So cool. Thatês the last questionnaire. No more questionnaires for you. Yay. I want to make sure Iêve got the right number for you before I press submit because then I canêt change it even Ä once Iêve submitted it. Ok. Everythingês good. Cool. So thanks again, and then Iêll just shoot you a text in like two weeks or so to make sure you got the last check and if you have any questions about mindfulness or any other programs like this that youêve heard of and are kind of interested in learning more about, Iêm more than happy to answer any questions that you might potentially have about it. You have my number so feel free to call me, or leave me a message and Iêll definitely get back to you.",9/25/15,F86,108,SUB, Ok then.,9/25/15,F86,109,INT, Ok. Thanks again. Iêll shoot you a text in about two weeks.,9/25/15,F86,110,SUB," Ok, that will be fine. And thank you for asking me to volunteer. I appreciate it.",9/25/15,F86,111,INT," Oh yeah, sure. Thank you. Again, like the whole goal of this is to be able to provide additional resources that isnêt being provided for sickle cell patients and without your help we wouldnêt really be able to move forward or make any progress, so I would say donêt sign up for all of the studies but if you feel youêre going to benefit from something or a study has a potential to benefit, researchers like myself are always grateful when youêre giving up your own time to help us, to potentially help others. So thanks again.",9/25/15,F86,112,SUB," Ok. No problem. (phone breaks up, unintelligible) You have a good day.",9/25/15,F86,113,INT, All right. I will talk to you later then.,9/25/15,F86,114,SUB, Ok. Bye bye.,9/25/15,F88,1,INT," Hi, (name redacted).",10/1/15,G88,2,SUB, Hi.,10/1/15,G88,3,INT," Ok, great. So thanks for being able to take care of this tonight. It sounds like the rest of the week is going to be kind of busy. Again, essentially what I want to do is just ask you a couple questions, wrap-up questions to get your thoughts and feelings about the mindfulness class and potential ways in which you feel I might be able to improve it, things that you like, things that you didnêt like. I just have sort of 10 starting questions, and thatês it. The questions are fairly broad. There are no right or wrong answers, just to sort of get your thoughts and your opinions about the mindfulness class. So does that sound good?",10/1/15,G88,4,SUB," Yes, uh huh.",10/1/15,G88,5,INT," Ok, great. The very first question then is would you be able to speak to how easy or how difficult it was for you to call in to the weekly mindfulness sessions?",10/1/15,G88,6,SUB," It was easy because I always called in about five minutes before. I think one time I called 10 Ä you know that it was always five minutes before, and I never had no problems. None at all.",10/1/15,G88,7,INT," Ok, so in terms of the timing of the call, being in the afternoons, that sort of worked well for your schedule it sounds like?",10/1/15,G88,8,SUB," Yes, that was better for me because during the day if someone comes around, my friends or children or family members want me to ride someplace, I love riding when somebodyês driving, I will go. I donêt hang out at night. Peopleês so mean now. I want to be home when the sun goes down. So yes, it was better for me.",10/1/15,G88,9,INT," Ok, great. The second question then is what impact, if any, do you feel the mindfulness program had on your perceptions of chronic pain?",10/1/15,G88,10,SUB," Now, I stopped focusing on the pain Ä hold on a minute. Hold on. (interruption) I was Ä my daughter was coming in and my alarm was going off. But I stopped focusing on the pain and the one I really loved was the loving kindness practice tips, and I was doing some of that anyway. When I passed people I would speak but I got more into it, asking people –How are you doing today?” or –Have a good day” or –Be safe” and stuff like that. And another one was, I stopped focusing on eating and you had to when you take snacks or when you eat, you know, because I just blew through that. I knew what I need to eat, or what I shouldnêt eat but I just eat all the time. Nothing stopped me from eating. And Ä but focusing on starting from my head and my feet and come up, that was a good one. Iêm trying to think of the name of it.",10/1/15,G88,11,INT," So you had mentioned the mindful eating one. And then the loving kindness. And you say the one in which you stand up, or Ä oh sorry, from the head to the toes. The body scan exercise.",10/1/15,G88,12,SUB," Yes. I like that one. And I find that one really works. Also the breathing tips it told me about. I like that one. So after I go through it and have been doing it since then I say it really works, it really helps. It makes you put your mind and focus on something else.",10/1/15,G88,13,INT, So would you be able to provide me an example perhaps of when or how you were applying one of those mindfulness exercises that you just described when you experienced pain or discomfort?,10/1/15,G88,14,SUB," Yeah, like the Ä itês not the breathing tip. It might be the breathing where you donêt focus on your hurting. Because when I start hurting, even after chemo, I was focusing on the pain, oh this pain is terrible in my legs and stuff. And then she told us donêt focus on that. You start focusing on something that made you feel good, thinking about someone in your life that made you feel happy or something. And I did. And I started thinking –This too shall pass” or I would start from my head and say –Hm, we went on vacation” or whatever we did. The good things. Try to think of good thoughts. And after I thought about good thoughts about my granddaughters _ I love spending time with my grandchildren _ it wasnêt bad. So if I take my focus off whatês going on and focus on something good, you donêt have time to focus on the pain. It seems like it didnêt last as long, the pain didnêt last as long. And also when I would leave, even if I had appointments or was going to get the chemo or whatever, and I would be nauseated or not feeling well, and I would start passing people, I thought –Now, theyêre older. They look like theyêre in real pain. You always think that your life or your situation is worse than anyone else. But itês not.” So I would get on the elevator with people and especially the ones that would have surgery on their head. I knew they had brain cancer. I would say –Hey, how are you?” And one gentleman, in a wheelchair, he said –Iêm doing good. Itês a good day. Iêm able to look down at the grass and see how green it is. If I was six feet under I couldnêt see that.” I say –You know, that makes sense.” He say –I am able to look up at the sky and see that itês blue. If so, Iêm having a good day.” I say, –You know, I am too.” So every time I would go, even though nobody like going to receive chemo or whatever, I just think Ä I would just always think of him and just think of that part where she said –always” it was loving kindness practice tips. Focus on Ä just say Ä ask people how they doing and have a great day, or if they ask you –Iêm good, Iêm happy, Iêm feeling great today” or just say something positive. And it just made me feel good, and it still does because Ä like sometimes I have like last week I was telling you we were going through a death, last year mom passed. And then I started looking at her pictures and she never gave up. She would always smile and Ä here I go again (voice quivering). Her last day she talked to all of her children and grandkids and great-grands, she talked to all us and gave us positive things like –You were raised in the church. You were raised believing in god. You all keep on loving each other.” And my mom sitting here telling us sheês ready to go. Sheês done what god has told her to do. And here I am saying I want to hold on to her, and sheês saying, she told us the hardest thing I have ever had to do was to give up and say bye to my husband and my children and my grandchildren, but I got to go. So when I was looking at her picture and she was smiling I say –Mom, I know you want us to be happy because you would not come back here if you could.” And I started saying –You did it. You battled lymphoma for over 17 years.”",10/1/15,G88,15,INT, (unintelligible),10/1/15,G88,16,SUB, Huh?,10/1/15,G88,17,INT, Thatês a very long battle. For 17 years?,10/1/15,G88,18,SUB," Yeah. And the doctors told her when she first got it she might live three months. But they called me, I was working at (name of company redacted) as a nurse, and when they told her about it they called me because the doctor said –You need to come home and talk to your mom because weêre telling her she has cancer and she keeps saying •god didnêt tell me that. God doesnêt tell me I got lymphoma or cancer, and Iêm leaning on him.ê” And I told them that was her belief. She has a strong faith in god. And so now Iêm in a better place. I only let that happen to me for maybe two to three days last week, and I said –Mm mm. Mom donêt want this.” So thatês my belief now, even when I go Thursday. Tomorrow. Whatever the CT scans show, and when I see Dr. (name redacted) I canêt do anything about it but Iêm thinking positive. And because whatês going to be is going to be. But like getting back to these classes, I really enjoyed them, like I told you before. The lady that was doing it, it was her voice. It was so soothing. And she had patience. Patience with us. And it was good.",10/1/15,G88,19,INT," Yeah, so I believe you started the sessions in early November or mid-November and they ended the final week of December. So during that period I know you had a lot going on. Like you started chemo during that time, I believe as well, right, and then still going into the sickle cell clinic. So you had Ä Iêm sure you were experiencing some pain related to the chemotherapy treatments. During that time, would you say, or can you recall if you had any pain that was specifically related to the sickle cell?",10/1/15,G88,20,SUB," The chemo I was receiving in that large dose made your joints in your legs and your legs hurt real badly because it was made out of tree bark, and they told me before I got it that was one of the side effects. So I couldnêt ever say if it Ä I did have crisis one time, maybe twice because I had to get transfused three times, but twice because my Ä you know, every time my hemoglobin was real low, and I kept getting real weak and I started having crisis then. I know when Iêm having crisis itês mostly in my lower back or sometimes I have problems breathing, get shortness of breath but it didnêt get short enough for me to go get the oxygen from the hospital emergency room or whatever. So I called the sickle cell team and I told them of my symptoms. I said usually I try to fight my crisis at home. Two to three days I drink a lot of water and take ibuprofen and Iêm ok, but I never did get that energy back. They said come on it. Either your hemoglobinês low or somethingês going on and we need to see how badly your crisis is at this time. So I would go and I would get my labs and they would tell me you need to be transfused. Thatês why youêre having a lot of the things youêre having now. ",10/1/15,G88,21,INT, Like the breathing issues?,10/1/15,G88,22,SUB," Uh huh. And (name redacted) the nurse practitioner ended up telling me –I know you donêt like taking narcotics and you depend on ibuprofen” but I stopped taking that because my creatinine was up and they thought it was making my creatinine levels go up but no it was the mass that was pressing against my Ä was on my pelvis pressing against the left kidney. She said all this pain in your legs, the chemotherapy makes you have pains too but we think Ä",10/1/15,G88,23,INT," Yeah, it sounds like maybe itês a combination of the sickle cell pain and the chemo just exacerbating that pain, sending you into a sort of Ä it doesnêt sound like too severe of a crisis but it definitely wasnêt something you were able to manage on your own in your home.",10/1/15,G88,24,SUB," Right. So I started taking the pain medicine and it helped. But my biggest problem was I should have called them the day it started but I always wait saying itês going to get better, itês going to get better. And it happened Friday I was in my cardiologistês office, and the pain kept getting worse, and the back pain started. I said I know Iêm in crisis now. My back is in pain too.",10/1/15,G88,25,INT," I actually have a question about this part. Sorry to interrupt you there. So with these feelings that you were getting leading up to the crisis, so you said you started to get the feelings a couple days before the Friday. So you were able to sense that something wasnêt quite right. At this point in time, had you been already applying any of the mindfulness techniques, and the second question or second part is do you feel the mindfulness exercises that you learned had any sort of positive impact on that experience?",10/1/15,G88,26,SUB," Yes, because they helped me to maintain instead of going crazy and ending up in the emergency room. Like I told you, like I keep going back to the loving kindness, I kept doing that to myself, saying –You know you done great. A lot of doctors and nurses tell you that you donêt look like a person with sickle cell disease. You done a great job all your life caring for yourself. This too shall pass. I know youêre not feeling good now but youêre going to feel good in the next few minutes.” I just kept talking about positive stuff. Then I started that focusing on Ä let me see, what am I going to do tomorrow or next week? Where am I going for vacation? What did we do last year? And it sort of relieved it some. But when I was in that bad pain it did not take it away completely. But when I started doing that in that office, waiting for the cardiologist, it did relieve it some because I was just sitting there moving and rubbing my legs and couldnêt hardly tolerate it and didnêt want my daughter to see it. But after I stopped focusing on it, it did help me some. ",10/1/15,G88,27,INT, Ok.,10/1/15,G88,28,SUB," Like I said, Iêm grateful I was able to get in this class because I learned a lot of stuff I was not doing for myself that helped me with my pain and to get through.",10/1/15,G88,29,INT," Great, so it definitely sounds like you found quite a few things useful from this class. So my question then is there anything that you didnêt find that useful within the class or anything that you would want to have less of?",10/1/15,G88,30,SUB," The only thing that I didnêt really focus on that much was Ä I think it was telling you about eating or take Ä I canêt remember whether it was 20 minutes to focus on eating, eat very slowly and when you take your time and chew your food slowly you wonêt eat a whole lot. And I said, –No, this is not for me.” I tried it but I start eating but I said –No, this is not enough” when I was finished. Because I eat slow anyway. And I said, –No this isnêt for me.” She was saying it would make you feel fuller too if you take your time and chew slowly. I said –Uh huh, ok.” I tried it but it didnêt make me feel any fuller.",10/1/15,G88,31,INT, Yeah.,10/1/15,G88,32,SUB," Like I said, I can eat regardless.",10/1/15,G88,33,INT," Yeah, itês very hard when you have a big plate in front of you and it smells good and all of that. So did the chemo really affect your eating at all? It sounds like youêve still been doing fairly well then, in terms of consuming calories.",10/1/15,G88,34,SUB," Mm hm. For a few days Ä like one week I lost I think it was 10 pounds. It did Ä I didnêt feel an effect of it until after the third day, the third or fourth day. And then I didnêt want anything. I would try to make myself eat or drink something and I couldnêt. And I lost the ideal weight that I wanted to get down to, like about 20 or 22 pounds by getting that high dose. ",10/1/15,G88,35,INT, Wow.,10/1/15,G88,36,SUB," Yeah because I was nauseated. But what happened there, that one time, maybe three days straight I didnêt take the medicine when I first got started on the chemo. I said –No, itês not going to happen to me. Iêm not going to get nauseated” and I didnêt take it. After I got started vomiting, I lost control of my whole body and everything, I thought about it. So the second dose I said –You know, Iêm going to be on top of this. Iêm going to start taking the nausea medicine and everything they give me to take Ä”",10/1/15,G88,37,INT," That probably helped out a little bit, right?",10/1/15,G88,38,SUB," Yeah, they give you medicines for it, all of that. So yeah, after that, I learned you will get nauseated and everything if you donêt do as they ask you to do. So Iêve been on top of it ever since. After they started seeing me, one time I was down 10 pounds or 15 pounds and they were like –Oh, you lost a lot of weight.” And I started falling in love with little ham biscuits. I wanted salty stuff. And I would eat country ham biscuit. And my daughter said –Mama, you donêt need that. You need to do this.” And they told her –anything she can eat, let her eat it.” And after that I got all that weight, they said –Youêre getting dangerous now. Youêre losing too many pounds at one time.” And I started focusing on that. Mm mm. Something else going to happen if you keep losing",10/1/15,G88,39,INT," Yeah. The whole sort of process is complete roller coaster, ups and downs and everything. So just two final questions related to the mindfulness, so I donêt take too much of your time. I know itês getting late. Youêve already been talking about this as weêve been having our discussion but the question is how easy or how difficult was it for you to practice mindfulness? So to practice the lessons that Julie, the instructor, would instruct you on during that once-a-night class and you applying or trying to do those exercises that following week?",10/1/15,G88,40,SUB," It was easy for me because you can do it even when youêre around people and they donêt know what youêre doing. Iêm thinking of how to focus or make myself think Iêm someplace else. Happy places, around happy people. And no one knew what I was doing. Like I tried to even Ä I did even turn my family on to it. And my daughters. And I told them when youêre going through, think positive and think of good thoughts and relax. I said you can also do deep breathing. You donêt have to breathe so that people can see you breathing, but do the breathing techniques. Breathe in and out slowly if you get nervous about anything or get mad. You breathe through it. Start counting those breaths and before you say something out of your mouth you shouldnêt say it because you canêt take it back once it comes out.",10/1/15,G88,41,INT, Yeah. Itês very hard to put the words back.,10/1/15,G88,42,SUB," And Iêm still doing it. Iêve been thinking about my daddy, worrying about him. Heês 86 and a lot of men canêt tolerate a lot of pain so when Iêm around him I havenêt been able to go a lot because of the chemo but Iêm trying to tell my family have patience with him. You know. Just start working on your patience because I worked on mine. A lot of things that would blow me out of the water or whatever, I donêt allow to do that anymore. I just calm myself, so yes. Iêm still doing it. Itês very helpful.",10/1/15,G88,43,INT, Mm hm. So youêve still been working on the techniques that you learned in the class and it sounds like youêre also telling your family members about them.,10/1/15,G88,44,SUB, Yes. And Iêm going to keep on doing them because theyêre good.,10/1/15,G88,45,INT," Mm hm. Yeah, especially when itês so easy to do sort of just like you said you could be doing these mindfulness exercises and the person right next to you has no idea what youêre doing. So itês kind of easy in that sense that you can practice these exercises or perform these exercises in anyplace at any time, minus say youêre driving a motor vehicle or something then itês probably good to be aware of your surroundings and what youêre working on. Letês see. Is there anything else youêd like me to know about your experience, whether itês something else positive or perhaps something negative? Your thought on how I might be able to improve this, make it better? If you have any type of suggestions.",10/1/15,G88,46,SUB," I donêt see how you can make it better. The only thing I said, the only one I didnêt Ä it wasnêt that I didnêt like it, Iêm just an overeater, and thatês something I got to fix. But I hope youêd be able to reach out to more sickle cell patients and take them for it because I remember working with them at the hospital when I was nursing. A lot of younger people donêt have patience, donêt relax when theyêre in pain, and I know it hurt. The pain is terrible. But if they can calm themselves and just realize by talking hateful to the nurses and doctors is not going to work. So when you get to that point you feel like youêre not getting what you want at that time when you want it, come down. Just start counting. Just start doing deep breathing. Focus on, you know when I go home Iêm going to do this, or Iêm going to have a good time. Just focus on positive stuff. And it will help because when I thought when you told me about it, meditating, –No, thatês not going to work for me.” But once I got into it, it truly works. It really does. A lot of the other people too, the other participants, were saying the same thing. I canêt say enough good stuff about it.",10/1/15,G88,47,INT," So actually Iêve got a question for you then. You mentioned that when you were younger or you see younger people that have difficulty, do you think this would be potentially good if Ä or to sort of get your thoughts on this. If I were to have this intervention available to teenagers or during the transition years, going from the pediatric to the adult clinic, do you think that might be a useful context, or do you think it would be kind of difficult for them to open up to the idea of something like this?",10/1/15,G88,48,SUB," As young as you can get them, get started with them. Thatês where they need it because now a lot of people a lot of doctors or whatever in the sickle cell department will tell you –Oh youêre not going to get strung out on that drug. Youêre not going to get hooked.” And they got in my chart that Iêm (unintelligible). No Iêm not. I know if I start taking something constantly my body will depend on it. And I saw a little child, I think that child was three or maybe three years old, when I was going to get my hair at the shop but I donêt have to do that now. And he told his mother he want his –cocadeen.” I looked at her and said –What did he just say?” He want his codeine. And he said –cocadeen.” So no, as young as you can start it with them, and where they would understand and they would sit long enough to do it, please do. Donêt wait until theyêre teenagers or older than that. I would start as soon as you can so they will learn and know what to do.",10/1/15,G88,49,INT," Yeah. Great. So thatês one of my next thoughts is how I could apply this intervention for additional age groups because Iêve heard this from quite a few other people as well and it seems like youêre singing the same story here, or singing the same song here, that this would be a very useful or potentially useful for the younger generation that by starting earlier they could have this additional skill set that they can then potentially apply for the rest of their life, it sounds like",10/1/15,G88,50,SUB, Mm hm. Yeah. ,10/1/15,G88,51,INT," It might be difficult to sort of convince them but I feel by even having this sort of having this initial step, this part of the study done, I think weêre going to get some really positive results out of it. Maybe that will help sort of sway some opinions, or at least have some people be open to the possibility or the option. I think that was how I sort of outline this with you, correct, that we donêt really know if this is going to have any positive or negative effects but typically something like this doesnêt really hurt you.",10/1/15,G88,52,SUB, Right. Thatês true.,10/1/15,G88,53,INT," Yeah. All right. Well you know, I just want to thank you again for being able to call into the weekly sessions and taking the time out to talk with me and call me. I know your life has had a lot of things going on in it but I am definitely incredibly thankful for your participation. Youêve been able to give me a lot of good insights into potential areas that have worked for you and potentially how to move forward. So I guess one last thing. You should have got the paycheck by now. I would have imagined, right?",10/1/15,G88,54,SUB," No, I havenêt. Mm hm.",10/1/15,G88,55,INT, Oh. Ok. So you havenêt gotten it.,10/1/15,G88,56,SUB, No. Uh uh.,10/1/15,G88,57,INT, So what Iêm going to do is Iêm going to go into the office tomorrow and Iêll speak with the gentleman who handles and processes all of those checks because it was submitted a little more than Ä probably Ä about two and a half or three weeks ago. Normally they take about 10 business days which is two weeks. But Iêll just double-check on that and see whatês going on and Iêll give you a call just to let you know. Or actually I donêt need to call you. Iêll just send you an e-mail since I know I have your e-mail just to sort of let you know what I hear back from them because it should be there. If it didnêt come on Monday or Tuesday hopefully by the end of this week. But just wanted to let you know I havenêt forgotten about that.,10/1/15,G88,58,SUB," Ok. I havenêt been worried about that. But Iêm going to keep your number _ you might change it _ but Iêm going to keep your number because I would like to know how things are going with it, and whether you were able to get more people to participate or whether you decided to reach out to any younger people.",10/1/15,G88,59,INT," Yeah, sure. Iêll keep your e-mail and stuff like that, and Iêll send you my personal e-mail. I believe you have my Duke e-mail address. I also have a google e-mail that I use for a lot of other things, and Iêm going to be leaving Duke in the next couple of months and going somewhere else for the rest of my research projects, so still definitely keep in touch and Iêll let you know the results of this study once I have all of those collected and analyze which should hopefully should be in the next two to two and a half months. It would probably be around early to Ä letês see weêre almost halfway done with February, so probably toward the end of March or the beginning of April. So I will definitely let you know how things turn out, but I think the results should be really really positive though.",10/1/15,G88,60,SUB, Are you coming back to Duke?,10/1/15,G88,61,INT," Yeah, so Iêm going to be graduating in June I believe it is so Iêm going to be finishing my PhD, defending my dissertation in June. And right now Iêve been applying for other positions so it looks like I might be going up to the NIH, the National Institute of Health in Bethesda. They have an institute called NHLBI, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. And they have a very large sickle cell program there. Theyêre working on bone and stem cell transplants and other future potential cures for sickle cell. So my goal is to work with some of the doctors there, incorporating in the same research study, the mindfulness program, and continue on.",10/1/15,G88,62,SUB," Well I wish you luck, keep going, but it seems like every time we get good people dealing with sickle cell people, because weêre very hard to deal with are stressful. I can go to my primary care with a problem and they now know what to diagnose it with. Letês call the sickle cell team. So you get referred back to the sickle cell team and they put everything on them to try to find out whatês wrong with us. So like, lord I canêt remember the doctorês name now that left. It seems like every time we get good people thatês concerned about us, they go. They leave Duke. I hope you Ä I know you got big plans and everything but I hope one day you decide to come back and stay at Duke permanently.",10/1/15,G88,63,INT," Yeah, well donêt worry about me leaving the sickle cell area. Thatês definitely going to be my primary focus as a clinician, researcher. It just becomes a question of where and what institute and the location. Duke would obviously be a great place to land. The NIH, Johnês Hopkins has a really good sickle cell program. University of Pittsburgh. I think in the next five to 10 years thereês been a lot more emphasis on sickle cell, itês been slow going when you look at what was being done in the 80s and the 90s and the early 2000s. Not really too much going on. There was obviously a lot of studies looking hydroxyurea and some other types of medications, and even just vitamins and very basic things, but in the last five to 10 years, letês say since 2005 to 2010, thereês been a lot more emphasis, and thatês in part due to the National Institute of Health putting a lot more initiatives and funding toward not only pain research but pain within sickle cell, so I think there should be some really good things coming up and hopefully Iêll be able to be a part of that.",10/1/15,G88,64,SUB," Ok, good. Good luck. Iêve enjoyed talking with you, and Iêm glad I had a chance to meet you.",10/1/15,G88,65,INT, All right (name redacted). Thanks again and if you ever have any questions in the future feel free to give me a call or send me an e-mail and Iêll be more than happy to chat.,10/1/15,G88,66,SUB, Ok. Thanks a lot.,10/1/15,G88,67,INT, All right. Thanks again. Bye.,10/1/15,G88,68,SUB, You have a good night.,10/1/15,G88,69,INT, All right. Good night.,10/1/15,G93,1,INT, Hey (name redacted) is that you?,11/1/15,H93,2,SUB, Yes sir.,11/1/15,H93,3,INT," All right, great. Thanks again for your participation and everything, and hopefully you were able to get a few new tips and tricks and things you were able to help yourself with from the participation. These questions that I will be asking you are all open-ended, there are no right or wrong answers. Like I said earlier, the intention of this is just to sort of learn more about your perspective on the program to help me make it better. The very first question is how easy or how difficult was it for you to call in to the weekly mindfulness sessions?",11/1/15,H93,4,SUB, It was easy for me. I have a (unintelligible) and I wasnêt going nowhere at 6,11/1/15,H93,5,INT," Ok. So it was pretty easy to call in, and then in terms of the time, the calls being in the evening, that worked out well with your schedule?",11/1/15,H93,6,SUB, Yes.,11/1/15,H93,7,INT," Ok, great.",11/1/15,H93,8,SUB, And even if I had forgotten that day you would let me know to call 30 minutes or 15 minutes before.,11/1/15,H93,9,INT, Mm hm. Yeah. So those text messages and those reminders were pretty useful.,11/1/15,H93,10,SUB, Mm hm.,11/1/15,H93,11,INT," Ok, great. Yeah, I feel a lot of people appreciated those just as a little reminder since schedules and stuff usually get fairly busy. So thatês great. So next question is what impact do you feel this mindfulness program had on your perceptions of pain?",11/1/15,H93,12,SUB," It helped me put my mind somewhere else. You know, it just helped you relax. When you in pain, your body tenses up and it hurts more. And when you relax, it donêt send it all away but it relax it.",11/1/15,H93,13,INT," Would you be able to give me an example. So letês say you were experiencing pain, what would you do in order to get relaxed?",11/1/15,H93,14,SUB," I lay down and you know how she Ä how your breathing Ä go from your toes Ä from tops to bottoms? And that ease it out. Because I donêt like taking pain pills, too much pain pills.",11/1/15,H93,15,INT, Yeah. So the breathing exercises really helped.,11/1/15,H93,16,SUB, Mm hm.,11/1/15,H93,17,INT, Ok. So that was about pain. So how do you feel Ä or do you feel the mindfulness program had any impact on your quality of life?,11/1/15,H93,18,SUB," Sure. It helped you not get angry quick. You know, it helped that. Take a deep breath.",11/1/15,H93,19,INT," Ok, so it had Ä it helped you with additional issues outside of pain. Or it had other sort of positive effects outside of pain.",11/1/15,H93,20,SUB," Yep. And when I was having trouble sleeping, you know when youêre laying there trying to go to sleep and your mind be wandering it helps you concentrate instead of your mind Ä",11/1/15,H93,21,INT," So in terms of Ä just to summarize there, with your sleeping it helped you, I guess relax a little bit more to make falling asleep easier?",11/1/15,H93,22,SUB, Yes.,11/1/15,H93,23,INT," Great. Letês see. Is there any other sort of examples? Or would you say that in terms of improving quality of life, so improving non-pain symptoms that the mindfulness program had the most benefit toward falling asleep in the evenings, or is there anything else?",11/1/15,H93,24,SUB," If thereês another way to relax the stress throughout the day, to relax.",11/1/15,H93,25,INT," Mm hm. Ok, so if youêd be feeling stressed out during the daytime youêd use this as a way of relaxing?",11/1/15,H93,26,SUB, Yeah.,11/1/15,H93,27,INT," Ok, got it. So next question is what did you find most useful about this mindfulness program?",11/1/15,H93,28,SUB," You were talking to other people that have sickle cell and going through the same symptoms you going through. And to me it was good. Itês another way to work without using pain pills and running to the hospital. You know, sometimes when you in crisis there ainêt nothing to do. (unintelligible) It was nice, you know, communication. And for an hour youêre making yourself (unintelligible) day. Because you know sometimes you just, you go through pain you just keep going on trying to do everything and not learn. I liked it.",11/1/15,H93,29,INT," So it sounds like with the group interaction, having the multiple people on the same call, that was something you really enjoyed?",11/1/15,H93,30,SUB, Mm hm. I really enjoyed that.,11/1/15,H93,31,INT," And then your sister was also on as well, right?",11/1/15,H93,32,SUB, Yes.,11/1/15,H93,33,INT, Yeah. So you got to spend some time talking with her during the program.,11/1/15,H93,34,SUB, Yes.,11/1/15,H93,35,INT, Were there any practices that you like the most or found the most beneficial in terms of helping you deal with pain episodes?,11/1/15,H93,36,SUB, I liked the breathing.,11/1/15,H93,37,INT," Ok, so the mindful breathing exercise. The one youêre talking about, the head to toe, or toe to head.",11/1/15,H93,38,SUB," Yeah, I loved that one.",11/1/15,H93,39,INT, That was something you would apply on a day-to-day basis?,11/1/15,H93,40,SUB, Yes. And I liked the one give out good thoughts.,11/1/15,H93,41,INT, Uh huh.,11/1/15,H93,42,SUB," You know, show kindness, think kind thoughts. ",11/1/15,H93,43,INT," Letês see. Ok. The sort of opposite question then, is there anything that you didnêt find helpful within this program or within the mindful exercises? Anything that you feel you could have done without?",11/1/15,H93,44,SUB, Mm mm. Everything was good to me. I liked everything.,11/1/15,H93,45,INT, Great. So you were sort of able to take away something from each of the different exercises and found them equally useful?,11/1/15,H93,46,SUB, Mm hm.,11/1/15,H93,47,INT," Ok. Cool. Is there anything that you would have wanted more of in this mindfulness program, like more talking time, more emphasis on a certain practice, those are just some examples I could think of, but is there anything that you could think of that you would have wanted more of?",11/1/15,H93,48,SUB," I think it was a good list on everything. And at the end, even sometime in the middle, she was comfortable for us. I think it was good. I think everything was good.",11/1/15,H93,49,INT," Ok, great. So not too much to complain about.",11/1/15,H93,50,SUB, Mm mm.,11/1/15,H93,51,INT," Ok, great. Then the next question I think youêve already sort of answered it but Iêll still ask it is, is there anything that you would not want within the program, or is there anything that you would eliminate?",11/1/15,H93,52,SUB," No. Because you would learn something new every week. And at the beginning she would go back over the same views, learn and ask you have you used it that week, and then she would teach you something else to use. I liked it.",11/1/15,H93,53,INT," So you liked how the class was set up in terms of the first half was a sort of review of what was previously discussed and talking about the next practice, and the second half of the class is actual practice of that new skill. You sort of like how that was set up?",11/1/15,H93,54,SUB, Yep. I like how that was set up.,11/1/15,H93,55,INT," Cool. Only two, three more questions and then thatês it, so just about done. How difficult or easy was it for you to practice the mindfulness exercises outside of the weekly telephone calls?",11/1/15,H93,56,SUB," It was easy because at night you could help relax yourself when youêre going to bed. During the daytime when somebody getting an attitude, you know, you step back _ you know they always say take a deep breath and donêt respond.",11/1/15,H93,57,INT," Yeah, sure.",11/1/15,H93,58,SUB," And even when people get on your nerves you think good thoughts about them, try to think good thoughts about them. And when you were eating it would help you concentrate on your food. Because you know, sometimes youêre like spoon-mouth, spoon-mouth, spoon-mouth. It gives you a chance to relax too.",11/1/15,H93,59,INT," Yeah, so it sounds like you were able to think of a number of ways of practicing during the week that you found fairly easy.",11/1/15,H93,60,SUB, Mm hm.,11/1/15,H93,61,INT," Great. So now since the program, the classes have finished, do you intend to continue using what you have learned from this mindfulness class?",11/1/15,H93,62,SUB," Yes, I use the breathing every day. I love the breathing one.",11/1/15,H93,63,INT, Great.,11/1/15,H93,64,SUB," And you know what is good? Relax your body to me, it gives you a chance _ to me _ to take note of whatês going on in your body.",11/1/15,H93,65,INT," Mm hm. So how have you found that to be helpful, if you might be able to explain a little bit about that, thatês something Iêm interested in. So with the mindfulness youêre saying that youêre now more in tune with what your body is telling you. Does that mean you have a better sense of when a pain episode might occur, and youêre able to sort of calm down and prepare yourself and decrease the stressors? Is that sort of what youêre getting at or is it something else?",11/1/15,H93,66,SUB," Yes. It helps me relieve the stress (unintelligible) hurt more to, make it hurt worse too.",11/1/15,H93,67,INT, Mm hm.,11/1/15,H93,68,SUB," And it let you know, you know, you just relax and concentrate on that spot, no from head to toe, and not just at that spot. Because to me, I do not like taking pain pills that much. Too much. I donêt like to have to lay down and go to sleep. But it helps me to relax my body with the pain pills I donêt have to take too much of it. And it help me, you know, specifically know if this is going to be a worse one or can I just relax to it.",11/1/15,H93,69,INT," Great. So it sounds like youêve really been able to learn how to focus more on what your body has been telling you, it sounds like. Is that a good Ä does that sound about right?",11/1/15,H93,70,SUB, Yes. Thatês it.,11/1/15,H93,71,INT, Awesome. Hm. So then my final question for you then is would you recommend this type of mindfulness program to someone else with sickle cell and pain.,11/1/15,H93,72,SUB," Yes, and I would tell them to take the class just to learn something new, and even with the people around them, like one time my nephew, my great-nephew, was staying with me and especially doing the breathing thing. He enjoyed listening to it, he enjoyed going through it too. Involve your family and it will help you.",11/1/15,H93,73,INT," I was going to say you would sort of recommend it to even people that donêt have pain or a chronic illness or sickle cell, that it could be used by anybody?",11/1/15,H93,74,SUB," Yes. It would help you stay calm. It would help you get to know your body. And it will help you relax. Because people will blow up angry quick. And some people even (unintelligible) and keep trying to do what they doing. And some people just need to relax. It will make you less stressful. And there for an hour, or even for 10 minutes, you got a moment to yourself. I would recommend it to anybody. Everybody I know.",11/1/15,H93,75,INT," Great. So that pretty much wraps up the questions that I had specifically for you. Is there anything else that you would like me to know about your experience about other ways that this program might have potentially helped you that I might have not addressed within these questions, or any recommendations for how I might be able to improve it?",11/1/15,H93,76,SUB, No. I loved it. I loved how it was set up.,11/1/15,H93,77,INT, Great. Sorry.,11/1/15,H93,78,SUB," I just cleared a moment, an hour on a Tuesday just for yourself, clear your schedule just to pay attention to yourself and just doing the conference. I liked it.",11/1/15,H93,79,INT," Great. Well thank you again, (name redacted) for taking the time to help me with some of these questions. Itês very much appreciated and Iêm very happy that you were able to use some of the techniques from this program to improve your pain management. I think thatês wonderful. So what Iêll do is Iêll check back in with you in about two weeks to make sure you that youêve gotten that last paycheck and then what Iêm probably going to do now is try to call your sister and see if I could ask her the same sort of questions and get her thoughts and perspectives on this program. Do you know what time of day might be best to contact her at?",11/1/15,H93,80,SUB, I called her yesterday around this time. She was at home. Sheês been going through crisis with the weather.,11/1/15,H93,81,INT, Oh. Really?,11/1/15,H93,82,SUB, Yeah. And her granddaughter going to for (unintelligible) support. It would be best to contact her now because he granddaughter get out at 2,11/1/15,H93,83,INT," Ok. Iêll try to give her a call, or Iêll try to reach her sometime this week. But thanks again and Iêll check back with you in about two weeks or so then?",11/1/15,H93,84,SUB, Ok.,11/1/15,H93,85,INT," All right, (name redacted). Thank you again.",11/1/15,H93,86,SUB, Bye.,11/1/15,H93,87,INT, All right. Bye.,11/1/15,H
