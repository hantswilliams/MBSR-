Sub,Line,Speaker,Text,Date,Participant39,1,INT, How are you?,8/1/15,C39,2,SUB," Good, how are you?",8/1/15,C39,3,INT," Good, good, yeah. You know, Iêm very happy to hear the good news about your new baby girl. Glad everything worked out well and thank you for sending me the photos. I like the little purple beanie that she had on.",8/1/15,C39,4,SUB," Yes, thank you.",8/1/15,C39,5,INT, So howês everything now then? Have things sort of calmed down a little bit?,8/1/15,C39,6,SUB," Yes, for the most part. Like I was saying, I was getting my dressing changed because I had a C-section and was on the blood thinner, Lovenox?",8/1/15,C39,7,INT, Blood thinner? Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,8,SUB," Yeah. And when they closed me up, I got a hematoma",8/1/15,C39,9,INT, Mm. So thatês not very good. Is it a small one or a big one?,8/1/15,C39,10,SUB," No, it was big. It was all the way across the incision, and the night we were discharged it opened.",8/1/15,C39,11,INT, Ugh.,8/1/15,C39,12,SUB, And so they decided to leave my wound open instead of stitching it closed again.,8/1/15,C39,13,INT, Just so it drains out?,8/1/15,C39,14,SUB," Yeah. So I have the wound (closure device) back on. But it takes all the moisture out, and it will close the incision from the inside out.",8/1/15,C39,15,INT," Yeah, those are interesting little devices that just work with gravity and negative pressure so you donêt really need to do anything to it. You just let it sit there and it does its job. Iêm glad that they were able to get that all fixed up and luckily nothing happened or anything. It sounds like they were able to get things under control relatively quickly.",8/1/15,C39,16,SUB, Yeah. They were.,8/1/15,C39,17,INT," You know, congratulations again on your child. Very, very beautiful. So then just then just sort of wanted to thank you again for your participation within the mindfulness classes. Hopefully you were able to get a few new things out of them. Iêm sure it was probably a very different experience than anything youêve previously tried, at least thatês what Iêve been hearing from other people that Ä a little bit off the beaten path but Ä",8/1/15,C39,18,SUB," It was very, very helpful though.",8/1/15,C39,19,INT, Mm hm.,8/1/15,C39,20,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,21,INT," Yeah, so thatês pretty much what Iêve been hearing from the other people who have also gone through with that. Itês different but it seems like each person is able to get something out of it that theyêve been able to find useful and implement within their own daily routine, either as a way of managing stress or pain, or something around those lines. So what I wanted to do is I have 10 fairly simple questions just to ask you about your experience in this mindfulness class to help me better understand your perspective on it in terms of what worked and what didnêt work. So thereês no right or wrong answers. Itês just getting your thoughts and perspective on this mindfulness program. So if itês all right with you Iêll walk through the questions _ theyêre all very simple _ just 10 of them, and feel free to give as short of an answer as you want. Or if you want to get more detailed in it, youêre more than welcome to get as detailed as you possibly want to. So does that sound good?",8/1/15,C39,22,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,23,INT," Ok, great. So Iêll just read the questions verbatim. The first one is how easy or difficult it was for you complete the weekly mindfulness classes, either in terms of calling in and the timing of the mindfulness classes.",8/1/15,C39,24,SUB, Besides the circumstances of being in the hospital for a couple of the classes it was easy. The call was ok for me since I donêt work.,8/1/15,C39,25,INT, Because I think it was maybe during the 2nd session you may have called in Ä I think it was when you were having a sonogram done. Is that correct?,8/1/15,C39,26,SUB, Um. Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,27,INT," Yeah, I think it was during one of the earlier sessions because I think you had texted me, or I asked you how everything was going and I think you mentioned that you had called in during one of the sessions when you were having a procedure done, which I thought was kind of cool, sort of an example of how if itês done by telephone you donêt need to be physically anywhere in order to participate with this sort of thing.",8/1/15,C39,28,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,29,INT," All right, cool. Yeah. So it sounds like relative easy for you in terms of calling in and stuff like that. So the second question then is sort of a two-part question. What impact, if any, do you feel this mindfulness program had on your perceptions of pain, and your quality of life?",8/1/15,C39,30,SUB," For the quality of life it had a pretty big impact because it was useful for stressful situations. And as far as pain, it helped somewhat because itês also hard to tune out the pain while doing the exercise.",8/1/15,C39,31,INT," So in terms of quality of life, you said it had a larger impact perhaps on that aspect rather than pain. Is there any example that you might be able to provide, or situations, or context of how does your mindfulness program of how youêve been able to use this mindfulness program to improve your quality of life?",8/1/15,C39,32,SUB," I could say when I got frustrated with having to be in and out of the hospital, and being stressed, and I used it in that situation.",8/1/15,C39,33,INT," Ok, sort of like stress related to hospital visits and I guess sort of the larger interactions with healthcare? ",8/1/15,C39,34,SUB, Correct.,8/1/15,C39,35,INT, Ok. Got it. The next question then would be what did you find most useful about this mindfulness program? Is there anything that you found more helpful in comparison Ä,8/1/15,C39,36,SUB, Like the breathing exercise?,8/1/15,C39,37,INT, Uh huh. Yeah. I was going to ask if there was any specific exercise that you found most effective.,8/1/15,C39,38,SUB, Yeah. Iêd say the breathing exercise.,8/1/15,C39,39,INT," Ok. So with the breathing exercise, is that the one that you sort of like to do the most?",8/1/15,C39,40,SUB," Yes, that one, and like where youêre lying down and youêre thinking of a happy place and the way you meditate and the sound, the smell, how you feel.",8/1/15,C39,41,INT, So sort of like the body scan exercise?,8/1/15,C39,42,SUB," Yeah, the body scan. Yeah.",8/1/15,C39,43,INT, Got it. Cool. So the breathing exercise and the body scan. So those are two exercises from the program that you found most helpful. Are there any aspects of the class that you didnêt find useful? Or is there anything that you feel might have been over-emphasized that didnêt need as much instruction?,8/1/15,C39,44,SUB, No.,8/1/15,C39,45,INT," Ok. So everything was fairly well-balanced in your opinion, in terms of the practices and exercises?",8/1/15,C39,46,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,47,INT," Ok, great. Letês see. My computer just decided to shut off there. And thatês where I have the questions. I do not have these things memorized. Ok. It looks like it turned back on. Ok, great. So next question is is there any part of the program that you would have wanted more of? Is there any one type of practice or topic that was brought up in one of the mindfulness classes that you feel should have had more emphasis?",8/1/15,C39,48,SUB, I donêt think so.,8/1/15,C39,49,INT, Ok. And I think you already sort of answered this next question is what would you eliminate or have less of in the mindfulness class?,8/1/15,C39,50,SUB, I wouldnêt eliminate anything.,8/1/15,C39,51,INT," All right, perfect. So just three more questions. I know that some of the participants within this class I wasnêt able to provide with audio recordings. Did you get any of the MP3 files, because I think I had sent to you but Iêm not 100% sure. At the beginning of the class, there were some different practice audio tapes, or audio recordings. Did you ever get those?",8/1/15,C39,52,SUB, Iêm not sure. Iêd have to check again. I know I got one.,8/1/15,C39,53,INT," Ok. All right. In terms of practice, did you find yourself being able to practice during the week or did you not have time to practice, or how much emphasis was there on practice for yourself in participating in this class?",8/1/15,C39,54,SUB," I was able to practice because I, of course, used some of the techniques. Itês just a matter of remembering.",8/1/15,C39,55,INT," Mm hm. So when you were practicing on your own, you were just sort of going off of the exercises that were taught during the class, and just trying to replicate those?",8/1/15,C39,56,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,57,INT, Ok. Got it. Was there any type of Ä earlier you had mentioned that the two practices or exercises that you found most helpful were the breathing exercise and the body scan exercise. So you obviously practiced those. Do you feel like you practiced those exercises more than the other exercises just because those were easy or did you practice everything equally or try everything?,8/1/15,C39,58,SUB, I tried everything but those were the two that I found most helpful for me.,8/1/15,C39,59,INT, Got it. So those were the two that clicked for you.,8/1/15,C39,60,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,61,INT," Ok. Great. So now that the class is over, do you intend on continuing using the mindfulness techniques?",8/1/15,C39,62,SUB, I do.,8/1/15,C39,63,INT," All right, great. Very last question then, would you recommend a class like this, this mindfulness class, to friends or other patients with sickle cell who also experience pain?",8/1/15,C39,64,SUB," I would, and not just patients just friends who are going through things, stress. I would share the techniques with them.",8/1/15,C39,65,INT," All right, great. So thatês pretty much all of the questions that I had for you in terms of your thoughts and perspectives on the mindfulness class, and then what Iêll do if youêre still looking to keep on practicing or trying to practice the breathing techniques and stuff like that, Iêll send you an e-mail that just has the audio recordings. Just in case you never got those previously, and you still want to listen to have some sort of guide to help you practice in the future, youêll have those for future reference. But other than that though, is there anything else that youêd like to tell me about your participation in this mindfulness class that I might have not talked about in terms of any other thoughts or feelings about it? ",8/1/15,C39,66,SUB," No, I donêt think so.",8/1/15,C39,67,INT," All right, so thatês pretty much it then. There is just a couple of questions I donêt have information from you, which is just sort of like background demographic information that I can just type in a form now, so Iêll do that on my end. Itês just five or six questions. Should take like 30 seconds. Let me just open that up quick and weêll be all finished. So sex, female; age, how old are you?",8/1/15,C39,68,SUB,27,8/1/15,C39,69,INT," 27. Letês see. Do you know your sickle cell genotype whether itês like SS, SC, beta Ä",8/1/15,C39,70,SUB, SS,8/1/15,C39,71,INT," SS. Ok. In terms of complications that youêve experienced related to sickle cell, I donêt know how familiar you are with some of the Ä Iêm sure youêre more familiar than I am, but in terms of like pulmonary hypertension or hip-knee problems, eyesight stuff Ä",8/1/15,C39,72,SUB," AVN, avascular necrosis of the lips Ä",8/1/15,C39,73,INT, Have you ever had ,8/1/15,C39,74,SUB, Iêve had two mini-strokes.,8/1/15,C39,75,INT, Ok. Two mini-strokes. Was that as a child then or recently?,8/1/15,C39,76,SUB, As an adult.,8/1/15,C39,77,INT, Ok. And then in terms of experiencing any altered or ocular sight difficulties.,8/1/15,C39,78,SUB, No.,8/1/15,C39,79,INT, Acute chest syndrome?,8/1/15,C39,80,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,81,INT," Ok. So in the last two years, how many emergency department visits related to sickle cell do you think you have probably had?",8/1/15,C39,82,SUB, Past two years? Emergency visits? Maybe eight.,8/1/15,C39,83,INT," Eight, ok. And then out of those eight visits, so sort of a very similar question but slightly different, how many hospitalizations related to sickle cell have you had over the last two years? And this could be counted as, you know, say you were in the emergency department and then from the emergency department you were then transferred to the main hospital as an inpatient.",8/1/15,C39,84,SUB, Iêd say five of those.,8/1/15,C39,85,INT," Ok. Are you being treated for, or have you ever been treated for depression or anxiety?",8/1/15,C39,86,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,87,INT, All right. What is your highest level of education?,8/1/15,C39,88,SUB, Trade school.,8/1/15,C39,89,INT, Ok. Trade school. What was the trade school in?,8/1/15,C39,90,SUB, Phlebotomy.,8/1/15,C39,91,INT," Oh, cool. Thatês definitely different.",8/1/15,C39,92,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,93,INT, Why did you make that choice?,8/1/15,C39,94,SUB," I always found it interesting, ever since I was little when I was going to Duke Pediatrics. There was a phlebotomist that taught me how to draw my own blood.",8/1/15,C39,95,INT," Oh, cool.",8/1/15,C39,96,SUB, She would let me draw my own blood whenever I came but ever since then thatês something I wanted to do.,8/1/15,C39,97,INT," Yeah. I feel that can be extremely stressful job when people have a small, tiny veins.",8/1/15,C39,98,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,99,INT, I feel it can either be really easy or really difficult.,8/1/15,C39,100,SUB," Yeah, and I worked in geriatrics.",8/1/15,C39,101,INT, So itês hard.,8/1/15,C39,102,SUB, So they had old veins.,8/1/15,C39,103,INT," Yeah. Fragile skin and everything, bruise really easily.",8/1/15,C39,104,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,105,INT," All right, so just three more questions. I think youêve already told me this but just wanted to double-check. What is your employment status? Full time, part time, full time school, part time school, or unemployed.",8/1/15,C39,106,SUB, Unemployed.,8/1/15,C39,107,INT, Unemployed. What is your insurance status?,8/1/15,C39,108,SUB, I have Medicaid and Medicare.,8/1/15,C39,109,INT," Ok. And then last question is what is your estimated household income? The categories that I had put were either under $25,000; $25,000 - $50,000; or above $50,000.",8/1/15,C39,110,SUB," Household income, Iêd say (pauses) above $50,000.",8/1/15,C39,111,INT," Ok, great. Yeah, so thatês the very last question then. Thanks for being able to help me out with those demographics and stuff. Itês just so we get a better idea of the range of different types of participants within this mindfulness class. Just sort of helps with when I try to replicate this study or go to a larger group of people, I have an idea of who itês already been tried on and who it hasnêt been tried on yet. So all of that is very helpful. But Iêd just like to thank you again. Thatês pretty much all of the questions that I have for you, so unless you have any questions for me thatês pretty much it. And like I said Iêd sent to you the last check for $50 so that was sent, I think, last Monday / Tuesday, and it usually takes Duke a couple days to process these things, and then send it out through the snail mail, through the USPS. So hopefully you should get it by the end of this week, Friday. If not Friday, Monday. If you donêt get it then, feel free to give me a text message, you know, call, and then Iêll go talk with the financial people and hunt down the check and see whatês happened to it. But otherwise, you got the first check for $10, correct?",8/1/15,C39,112,SUB, Yes.,8/1/15,C39,113,INT," Ok, cool. And then I donêt know if I told you or not but I was out of town for the pretty much the whole month of July / August which is why I wasnêt able to send that second check there. So then in order to compensate I figured it was just as easy to throw together the last two payments of $20 and the $30 and so one check to just make it easier, so donêt need to worry about sending a bunch of checks, and itês also cheaper as well because postage still costs quite a bit of money, amazingly.",8/1/15,C39,114,SUB, Right. So your dad is doing ok?,8/1/15,C39,115,INT," No, he ended up passing away. He had two different types of cancer actually. So he was battling that for the last 2-1/2 years and he was on chemo off and on. I think that just sort of tired him out which I think would tire any normal person out. And he was getting older and stuff, so he had an uphill battle. But I was able to see him before he passed away.",8/1/15,C39,116,SUB," Oh, Iêm sorry.",8/1/15,C39,117,INT," Yeah. So it was definitely a difficult time but for as bad as it was, everything works out eventually. It just sort of Ä I was glad I was able to get home for a little bit and help out my mom and my little brother and stuff. ",8/1/15,C39,118,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,119,INT," Yeah. It definitely wasnêt a very happy trip to California. Usually when I go back home to California I go over there with a smile on and stuff like that. I still had a smile on, it just wasnêt Ä no one really wants to make that sort of trip out.",8/1/15,C39,120,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,121,INT," Thank you for asking though. I guess thatês how things go. He had leukemia and also lymphoma, and the type of leukemia he had was a very rare type where with Ä it was a rare lymphoma where you usually Ä lymphoma is usually located in the lymph nodes, which is why itês called lymphoma. But his was located inside of his heart which made it pretty difficult to treat, and they werenêt sure what type of treatment they wanted to use and what kind of drugs and all that sort of stuff, so it was kind of a difficult case to manage. But he got Ä he still got Ä I think from the time he was diagnosed to the time he passed away he had additional 2-1/2 years to live. Otherwise, if he wouldnêt have gotten any treatment he probably would have died 2-1/2 years ago. So Iêm happy he at least got a little extra time and he had a long life, and all that sort of stuff. But thatês the way things go, unfortunately. We all canêt live till weêre 200 years old.",8/1/15,C39,122,SUB, Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,123,INT, I donêt know if weêd want to live till weêre 200 with the way things are going.,8/1/15,C39,124,SUB, I donêt know if anybody wants to nowadays.,8/1/15,C39,125,INT," Yeah. But thanks again, and Iêll still be around the clinic and stuff like that. I got about another year or so left here over at Duke and Iêll still be working in the clinic Monday through Friday, typically in the mornings, so Iêll look out for you and Iêll definitely catch up with you the next time I see you in the clinics for another clinical appointment. Because youêll still be seeing Ä I guess youêll still be seeing an OB/GYN specialist in addition to (name redacted) or Dr. (name redacted) in the next month or so, correct?",8/1/15,C39,126,SUB, Right.,8/1/15,C39,127,INT," Yeah, just for the post-op or Ä for the Ä",8/1/15,C39,128,SUB," Post-partum, yeah.",8/1/15,C39,129,INT, Follow-up.,8/1/15,C39,130,SUB, Mm hm. Yeah.,8/1/15,C39,131,INT," All right, so thanks again. Donêt want to take up too much of your time here. But it was great meeting with you and talking with you. And I will definitely look forward to seeing you more, and like I said Iêll e-mail you those audio recordings now so if you want to keep on practicing or just to have some sort of audio tapes, so if you ever want to go back and try some of this mindfulness stuff again youêll at least have some material to start with.",8/1/15,C39,132,SUB, Ok.,8/1/15,C39,133,INT," All right, I hope your recovery is very short and everything gets back to normal, and congratulations again with your new little baby girl.",8/1/15,C39,134,SUB, Thank you.,8/1/15,C39,135,INT," All right (name redacted), thank you again.",8/1/15,C39,136,SUB, Ok. You take care.,8/1/15,C39,137,INT, All right thanks. Bye.,8/1/15,C39,138,SUB, Bye bye.,8/1/15,C
