Sub,Line,Speaker,Text,Date57,1,INT," Just starting off with a couple of questions, just will be a discussion, just fill in as much as you want or as little as you want. So the first question Iêve got to begin is how easy or difficult was it for you to complete the weekly telephone calls in terms of calling in or arranging around your schedule?",8/15/1557,2,SUB, When I was off work of course it was easy but when I was at work I would be rushing to be off by about 3,8/15/1557,3,INT," Mm hm. Ok. So disregarding the comment, which weêll get to later, which was how it would have been better to have perhaps in-person sessions, but the feasibility to be able to call in and Ä",8/15/1557,4,SUB," Right, that was the (unintelligible) the commitment. Whereas if it was a classroom, I would have been able to say –Hey, I have to go here at 3",8/15/1557,5,INT," Ok. Cool. Then specifically with this mindfulness program, do you feel it had any effects or influence on, one, your perceptions of pain and, two, your quality of life?",8/15/1557,6,SUB," Yeah. It definitely did. It made me think about what to do when pain comes. Because normally what I would do is just lay there for a while, not really relaxing but not just focusing on the pain instead of focusing on how to eliminate the pain. So it really helped me (unintelligible).",8/15/1557,7,INT," Ok, cool. And then outside of the realm of pain, did you find it helpful for anything else?",8/15/1557,8,SUB," Yes. Extremely. When I get frustrated, mad, sit down and think about it. I think about the situation, how could things be different, why is the other person acting like this? And stuff like that. And that really helps me in my mind on that matter.",8/15/1557,9,INT, So really just slowing down and being aware of whatês going on and why itês going on.,8/15/1557,10,SUB, Thinking about other people instead of being selfish about certain situations.,8/15/1557,11,INT, Got it. So out of the Ä so I think you attended about four out of six of the sessions Ä what did you find most helpful?,8/15/1557,12,SUB, I donêt know what itês called but she told us to close our eyes and feel the blood flowing through our veins Ä,8/15/1557,13,INT, The body scan exercise maybe?,8/15/1557,14,SUB," Right. Right. And that really helped me. And she was like –If youêre having pain, focus on that one area and let the blood flow into that area” and it really helped me.",8/15/1557,15,INT, So sort of the visualization aspects of it.,8/15/1557,16,SUB, I think I missed the one about food.,8/15/1557,17,INT, Ok. Yeah. Might have been.,8/15/1557,18,SUB, Yeah. I missed that one but all the other ones I got were good.,8/15/1557,19,INT," Ok, cool. So sort of the opposite question then, was there anything in the program, in the classes, that you feel werenêt that helpful or donêt need as much focus?",8/15/1557,20,SUB," No, not really because what works for me might not work for someone else. You know what Iêm saying? Like Ä I mean, what helps me might not help you, and vice versa. So I canêt really say that anything needs to be taken away.",8/15/1557,21,INT, So letês say like for you personally. So were there any exercises that didnêt really resonate well with your own style?,8/15/1557,22,SUB," Not really. Not really. But I felt like all of them were like good as far as getting you to think about pain, like pain management. I found that sometimes it worked better than a prescription for pain. So it was good to me.",8/15/1557,23,INT," Interesting. So very different type of, I guess, relationship with the pain experience now perhaps?",8/15/1557,24,SUB," Right, right.",8/15/1557,25,INT, I can imagine it sort of varies depending on the type and the degree and the duration of the pain that you might be experiencing.,8/15/1557,26,SUB," Right, right, right, right.",8/15/1557,27,INT," So in going down that sort of path, what sort of painful situations have you found yourself applying these techniques, and can you provide me with an example?",8/15/1557,28,SUB, You mean as far as like sickle cell pain?,8/15/1557,29,INT, Yeah. You know Ä,8/15/1557,30,SUB, Really I havenêt had to apply them to any sickle cell pain because I havenêt really had any.,8/15/1557,31,INT, Everythingês been good. Yeah.,8/15/1557,32,SUB," So far. I mean. Iêve had a headache, like a sinus headache or whatever, but I really havenêt had any pain.",8/15/1557,33,INT," Ok, cool. So since the class has ended, have you tried to practice any of the exercises or Ä",8/15/1557,34,SUB, Every day. Every day. I donêt have sickle cell pain that often. Like Iêll find myself thinking about things sheês said and how I can apply them to my life and make a better me.,8/15/1557,35,INT, Just all the other every day stress relief?,8/15/1557,36,SUB, Exactly.,8/15/1557,37,INT," Youêve got pain, and then have all the other types of pain related to living.",8/15/1557,38,SUB, Yep.,8/15/1557,39,INT, So I think you sort of talked about this a little bit but how easy or difficult was it for you to practice the exercises on your own that you learned during the class sessions?,8/15/1557,40,SUB," At first I had to eliminate everyone around me because sometimes my nephew comes over to my house and all that, and heês noisy and all that. I just had to take a step back and think about getting alone to myself, like it requires you Ä these exercises require you to be alone so you can get relaxed, so thatês what I did.",8/15/1557,41,INT, So for you it was about getting into a nice quiet space.,8/15/1557,42,SUB, Right.,8/15/1557,43,INT, Ok. Cool. So it was really just trying to get into an area where then you could concentrate and focus on the exercise and not have any type of distractions from your nephew or family.,8/15/1557,44,SUB, Right. Exactly.,8/15/1557,45,INT," And once you had the distractions away, then youêd be able to easily practice?",8/15/1557,46,SUB, Mm hm. (yes),8/15/1557,47,INT, Ok. Cool. So sort of like one of the final questions then is would you recommend this mindfulness class to someone with sickle cell or to another friend?,8/15/1557,48,SUB, Definitely. Iêd recommend this to regular people without any kind of disease because it really helps with any pain really.,8/15/1557,49,INT," Yeah, I definitely think youêre 100% right there. Itês actually easier as well to acquire this sort of skill when youêre healthy than when youêre sick and having a painful sort of crisis that, you know, when youêre in pain the last thing you want to do is learn some new coping mechanism when youêre in excruciating pain. All you want to do is focus on nothing then, right? Or the polar opposite of what pain is.",8/15/1557,50,SUB, Pretty much.,8/15/1557,51,INT," Yeah. So sort of Ä that is something I was thinking might be a potential barrier, depending on the degree and the amount of pain that the participants in this type of mindfulness program are experiencing at that particular time. It might potentially influence how well or how not well they might be able to learn whatês being taught in the classes and then applied to their own lives. But it sounds like, at least for your case, it turned out fairly well. Youêre able to learn some new things and incorporate it into your daily schedule.",8/15/1557,52,SUB, Right. Right. It was definitely good for me.,8/15/1557,53,INT," So one thing that Iêve been thinking about _ and Iêd be interesting in getting your thoughts on this _ so I donêt remember too much of your chart from the last time I was looking at it, but in terms of how frequently you have pain crises, are they fairly frequent or not that frequent?",8/15/1557,54,SUB, It all depends on the time of the year.,8/15/1557,55,INT, It was like one to two a year for you?,8/15/1557,56,SUB," No, itês more than that. More like Ä two times a year. Three. Maybe. When it gets cold outside.",8/15/1557,57,INT," So is there any sort of transition period between fall, winter Ä",8/15/1557,58,SUB, It usually happens like in winter.,8/15/1557,59,INT," Oh, ok.",8/15/1557,60,SUB," So like late December, early January, February. Usually happens. But then when springtime comes around, things start to blossom and stuff it typically dies down.",8/15/1557,61,INT," Yeah, so, the reason I was asking that question, something I have heard from other patients and would be interested in getting your thoughts on this, was for some people the Ä what Iêve heard is the most Ä the thing theyêve been able to get out of it is more for bodily awareness, in terms of being able to sense things, perhaps, earlier, so Iêve heard a lot about this issue where thereês a plateau or a certain peak where once your pain gets above that threshold youêve got to go to the ED or to see your doctor.",8/15/1557,62,SUB, Right.,8/15/1557,63,INT," Or whatever medications you do, or what you try and change, nothing is really going to help the pain. So what Iêve heard from a few people is that theyêve been able to become more aware and further, through preemptively notice signs potentially of an incoming crisis, just by being more aware of the bodily sensations and being able to focus on the presence of the current moments. So I was wondering if you had that similar experience. But you havenêt really had any pain crises in the past couple of months it seems like, correct, since participating in the study?",8/15/1557,64,SUB," Correct. Right. I definitely notice it. So what I do, is like if I feel a pain crisis coming on, if itês like February, and I feel pain coming, I go ahead and take the pills, but now I have this resource that I can use so I would take the pills and then I would try to do this. And then when the pain got to a certain level thatês when I would have to go to the emergency room.",8/15/1557,65,INT," Cool. So now the plan is to implement this as your Ä like an addition to the pain meds. Just another type of tool in the shed, or whatever analogy or metaphor you want to use.",8/15/1557,66,SUB, Right.,8/15/1557,67,INT," Ok, cool. It seems like thatês what Iêve been hearing more so now is that with this Ä might not necessarily decrease the physical sensation of pain but at least make you more aware of pain crises, and then being able to change your behavior whether itês drinking more water or finding a quiet environment or whatever more preemptively to avoid the pain sort of spiking and going up so at that point itês no longer really manageable on your own. So instead of maybe this mindfulness decreasing pain, it at least it allows you not to have the pain increase any further than what it already is. It might sort of allow you to make these sort of behavioral changes or physical changes to your environment or eating the food, whatever it might be.",8/15/1557,68,SUB," Usually I can tell what itês going to lead to, and if it comes like numb and all that I know I need to go to the ER. But if itês just like a throbbing pain, it usually goes away. ",8/15/1557,69,INT," In terms of like the spans of this sort of sensation of this feeling of being able to potentially predict whether itês going to go away or turn into a crisis, how long a period can you usually Ä",8/15/1557,70,SUB, Like an hour.,8/15/1557,71,INT, An hour or so? ,8/15/1557,72,SUB, Yes.,8/15/1557,73,INT," Ok, so itês relatively a short period. So itês not like a couple hours and then it slowly progresses over a day or two days",8/15/1557,74,SUB," Mm hm. But when I get it, I got admitted one time, and it had got to that level that I had to come to the ER, and it wasnêt like a day or two days before like it had been, but after I got admitted it was still hurting the next few days. So I didnêt know before but I definitely felt it after.",8/15/1557,75,INT," So thereês definitely some variability in that experience, I guess. But in terms of noticing it before it begins, itês a relatively short period.",8/15/1557,76,SUB, Mm hm.,8/15/1557,77,INT, Ok. Cool.,8/15/1557,78,SUB," I mean, for me.",8/15/1557,79,INT," Oh yeah. It definitely seems like it differs in people. In some people it might be a day or two. Some itês like 10-15 minutes, and then itês full-blown crisis.",8/15/1557,80,SUB," Right, right.",8/15/1557,81,INT, Well thatês pretty much all of the questions that I had for you. If you had any other questions for myself about the study Ä,8/15/15
