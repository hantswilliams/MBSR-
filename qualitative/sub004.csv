Sub,Line,Speaker,Text,Date,Participant4,1,INT," There are 10 questions, pretty brief and straight-forward just to get your thoughts on the program. So the very first is if you could talk to me about how easy or difficult it was for you to complete the weekly mindfulness sessions.",7/7/15,A4,2,SUB, The conference call?,7/7/15,A4,3,INT, Correct.,7/7/15,A4,4,SUB," Yeah, so that was fairly easy. It was just a matter of making sure I remembered to call in at the right time and I think you all did a great job sending reminder e-mails and reminder text messages.",7/7/15,A4,5,INT," Ok, cool. So like in terms of being able to call in and listen for the full 60 minutes, was that relatively easy or did you feel like that time period was too long or too short to be able to sort of understand what was going on, and to really try and have enough time to grasp the concepts that the instructor was talking about?",7/7/15,A4,6,SUB," I think that an hour was appropriate. It was enough time for the leader to go through the specific concepts and meditation types that we talked about, and also enough time for Û to provide feedback and have discussions about it.",7/7/15,A4,7,INT," Ok, cool. So Û what question was I going to ask? Something you had mentioned. So in terms of calling in then with the telephone, was that relatively easy for you in terms of that being an acceptable form of communication?",7/7/15,A4,8,SUB," Yeah, I think that worked out really well, particularly the conference calls where we were all able to hear each other Û we were all able to have a discussion, have a conversation. The conference call is a good format. I think I like that more so than having to come to a place and be there in person. I was more comfortable in my own space.",7/7/15,A4,9,INT, It definitely sounds like a convenience factor.,7/7/15,A4,10,SUB, Yes. Definitely more convenient. And another alternative.,7/7/15,A4,11,INT," Yeah. I guess that was sort of the hope there, to try and make it as easy as possible. Ok, cool, so Û",7/7/15,A4,12,SUB," Because of the time, I think, doing it later in the evening, would work better because 5",7/7/15,A4,13,INT," Ok, cool. Yeah, we actually had Û I got a similar comment from someone else that was in the class with you that it seems like 5 pm might not have been the most ideal time. Itês sort of rush hour time. Everyone is either leaving work, or trying to go home, or eating dinner. Thereês definitely something going on. So we were able to take that feedback to where our next group and scheduled them at 3 pm instead of 5 pm, sort of taking that into account because sort of figured that out about halfway through, I think, maybe 5 pm wasnêt the best time. But it had to do with the hours available for the instructor and stuff like that. But trying to make that a little bit easier. So, ok, in terms of the overall impact of this mindfulness program, do you feel it had any effects on your perception of chronic pain, or your pain experience?",7/7/15,A4,14,SUB," In terms of the chronic nature of my pain, no, itês still there, itês still pervasive. But Iêve noticed that when I have spikes of pain, when it gets worse, being able to kind of sit down and calm myself and meditate has been helpful. Kind of like really acute episodes.",7/7/15,A4,15,INT," Ok, so less so with the chronic, lingering, nagging sort of type of pain but more so with the acute sort of short bursts of pain episodes. So what would an example be of, say, acute pain that you have experienced where you then perform some sort of meditative practice, or is there any that you might be able to think of that you can provide as an example?",7/7/15,A4,16,SUB," I canêt think of any certain examples during the duration but I have been meditating, for example, is today Friday? Wednesday, I was at work in my office and I had a spike of pain in my right arm, and so I just closed my laptop, got into a meditative posture in my chair, and tried to focus on breathing.",7/7/15,A4,17,INT," Ok, cool. So that was doing the breathing exercise then?",7/7/15,A4,18,SUB," Yes, the breathing exercise. Correct.",7/7/15,A4,19,INT, Ok.,7/7/15,A4,20,SUB," I found that to be the most helpful of the techniques that we learned. There was one, the body scan, wasnêt helpful to me. Itês focusing on the area where the pain is coming from, for me personally, isnêt helpful. It makes it worse. For me to focus on the breath is definitely helpful.",7/7/15,A4,21,INT, Ok.,7/7/15,A4,22,SUB, Just remembering to breathe and all that. Itês helpful.,7/7/15,A4,23,INT," Great, so it sounds like youêve been able to incorporate in at least that one practice into your daily activities or your ... or how you manage pain.",7/7/15,A4,24,SUB," Definitely, definitely, yeah. It even helps with having anxiety. I use meditation for anxiety too. And itês a similar experience where it isnêt as helpful for chronic worry, or chronic anxiety or pain, but for acute episodes or when I felt panicky, meditating in the moment is helpful.",7/7/15,A4,25,INT," Ok. Right. So I think you sort of answered my next question, what did you find most useful about the mindfulness program, and it sounds like the breathing exercises youêve been able to find pretty useful in terms of managing pain. But in terms of the program, what do you think was the least useful skill or part that you were taught?",7/7/15,A4,26,SUB," I donêt recall the name of it but it was positive affirmations, the one where youêre kind of sending positive feelings to yourself. That one wasnêt very helpful for me. And also the body scan. It wasnêt helpful either. But I can see how that would work for other people. Just personally it didnêt.",7/7/15,A4,27,INT," Ok, got it. So itês just like Û I guess it just doesnêt really work with your way of self-management.",7/7/15,A4,28,SUB, Exactly. Exactly. But I do appreciate knowing that technique.,7/7/15,A4,29,INT, What did you think of the eating exercise?,7/7/15,A4,30,SUB," That one was really interesting. Iêm kind of a slow eater so itês something that I kind of do naturally or unconsciously, try to think about the food that Iêm eating, where it comes from, what it feels like, what it tastes like, and just really enjoying the food.",7/7/15,A4,31,INT," Yeah, just kind of taking your time and experiencing all the smells and the textures and all of the sort of movement of the jaw and that sort of stuff?",7/7/15,A4,32,SUB," Right. Right. And normally, before I focused on the taste or maybe think about where it came from, but putting all of those different aspects _ taste, texture, origin, all that into one exercise was interesting. It was fun.",7/7/15,A4,33,INT," Yeah. Yeah. Thatês definitely one of those interesting exercises which makes you think about things that you donêt normally think about, especially things that are very mundane and everyday activities like eating that we donêt typically give a lot of thought to, which is kind of interesting. People either, I feel, really like it or they are just sort of confused by it.",7/7/15,A4,34,SUB, I can see that. Yeah.,7/7/15,A4,35,INT, So next question. Is there any part of the mindfulness program that you would have liked to have more practice with or more emphasis with in the program that you feel you might have benefitted from more practice or more information from?,7/7/15,A4,36,SUB," Visualization, so thinking about different places while youêre meditating. Because one of the things that Iêve learned with pain is that if I can focus on something else or visualize something then that is helpful in reducing my pain. In the past Iêve imagined a black hole and then pushing my pain into that black hole. And sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesnêt. But I think that having some kind of formal instruction in that would be helpful.",7/7/15,A4,37,INT," Ok, so something more with visualization then.",7/7/15,A4,38,SUB, Right. Right.,7/7/15,A4,39,INT, Ok. So thatês something that you would want more of. Is there anything within the program you feel that you would Û that you think might or should be eliminated or less time or emphasis should be placed on?,7/7/15,A4,40,SUB," No, from what I recall, at least one person got something out of all the activities that we did, so I think it was a good balance. ",7/7/15,A4,41,INT, Ok. So itês pretty well-balanced. ,7/7/15,A4,42,SUB, Mm hm. (yes),7/7/15,A4,43,INT," All right. Letês see. Three more questions. So in terms of the practicing of the mindfulness outside of the one hour weekly telephone call, was that difficult to find time to practice the skills that the instructor was teaching in terms of the actual practice, or in trying to find the time or place to practice, and sort of incorporating it into your schedule?",7/7/15,A4,44,SUB," For me, yes. Less so finding a place, but just being deliberate about practicing for 15 minutes a day. Yeah. I didnêt always meditate every day. Yeah, so no. It wasnêt that it was difficult. Itês just that I didnêt always practice outside of it.",7/7/15,A4,45,INT, Ok. It sounds like youêre breaking up a little bit there so I got part of it. So it sounds like it wasnêt too difficult to practice but itês just hard to find the time within the days to practice?,7/7/15,A4,46,SUB, Correct. Yes.,7/7/15,A4,47,INT," Cool. Got it. So letês see. So now that youêve finished with the mindfulness program, I think you already sort of answered this, do you plan on continuing to practice these sort of meditative skills and techniques you were taught? It sounded like you had provided me with an example earlier, you were saying last Friday or whatever, of having an acute pain episode and being able to do the breathing exercise. But Iêll let you answer.",7/7/15,A4,48,SUB," Yes. Definitely something that I want to continue to do. And I think itês very helpful, not just for the pain but also for well-being.",7/7/15,A4,49,INT," Ok, so more like a general quality-of-life.",7/7/15,A4,50,SUB, Exactly.,7/7/15,A4,51,INT, Cool. Letês see. Would you recommend a mindfulness program like this to a friend or to another person with sickle cell?,7/7/15,A4,52,SUB," Yes, definitely I would. It would be helpful for anyone with chronic pain, and just people in general. Meditation is something a lot of people can benefit from.",7/7/15,A4,53,INT," Yeah. I definitely agree with you there. Itês one of those things that I feel like the hardest aspect of practices like these is just getting into the routine of doing it on a daily basis, or setting aside a specific time within your schedule to sort of try to incorporate it in; but then once you do, it becomes a lot easier and you start to see more of the positive benefits. Just like anything else, when you first get started with it, it can be a little bit difficult to get into the groove of things but Û",7/7/15,A4,54,SUB, Exactly. Exactly.,7/7/15,A4,55,INT, Yeah. But Û,7/7/15,A4,56,SUB, I agree that getting into the habit is difficult. Being deliberate about setting aside time to do it.,7/7/15,A4,57,INT, Whatês your normal Û is your job Monday through Friday?,7/7/15,A4,58,SUB," Primarily, yes, but I also work on the weekends. So Iêm in grad school. Iêm not taking classes now but teaching courses.",7/7/15,A4,59,INT," Yeah, because youêre doing your PhD in psych, right?",7/7/15,A4,60,SUB, Yes. Yes.,7/7/15,A4,61,INT, Yeah. ,7/7/15,A4,62,SUB, Teaching and also developing a course.,7/7/15,A4,63,INT, Oh. Cool. What Û which course are you working on?,7/7/15,A4,64,SUB," So itês for my preliminary exams, developing a course on virtual communities, how theyêre constructed, what they look like, how you characterize a virtual community, but also how they can be used as a form of emotional support.",7/7/15,A4,65,INT, Ok.,7/7/15,A4,66,SUB," For a member, but also for people with health conditions, a chronic medical condition.",7/7/15,A4,67,INT," That definitely sounds quite interesting. I was listening Û when I was driving earlier this morning I was listening to a podcast and they were talking about the applications of that game, Minecraft and how thatês being used in a lot of educational settings and stuff now, not only to teach history lessons and things about the government but also incorporating in social skills and how it all sort of blends together. I thought it was really interesting. I wasnêt really aware that programs like Minecraft _ I was aware of it as like a video game but not as an actual virtual world where people are interacting and you can pretty much do whatever you want to do.",7/7/15,A4,68,SUB," Yeah. I never played Minecraft but I think Û I havenêt heard that podcast but Iêve seen a couple of studies that talked about it in terms of social aspects. And also hand-eye coordination and a couple other things. But yeah, yeah, the games are really interesting. They are a form of virtual community.",7/7/15,A4,69,INT," Yeah, so itês going to be interesting to see where all this technology goes, especially with the new DR and youêre incorporating in new things from the virtual and the actual real world, and how all thatês going to be integrated in, and what the effects are, in a sort of way of interacting with other human beings and, I guess non-human beings. Itês going to be quite intriguing. But yeah, so thatês like pretty much it though in terms of the questions. Is there anything else that you want me to know about your overall experience that I might have not touched on?",7/7/15,A4,70,SUB, No.,7/7/15,A4,71,INT," Anything that might have stood out, you know, anything strange.",7/7/15,A4,72,SUB, Oh. The survey. So we did 3-on-1 surveys? Once in the beginning then halfway through and one at the end? So I think Û So Û I wasnêt very good about tracking my meditation with the log but I think it would have been easier if there were a question that asked how many hours did you spend meditating on the last two or three.,7/7/15,A4,73,INT," Ok, got it. So like some sort of digital version of that form that you could just go onto the Web and fill out?",7/7/15,A4,74,SUB, Right. Right. Incorporate it into the survey.,7/7/15,A4,75,INT," Ok, cool. I was thinking about different ways of doing that because I guess youêre sort of like on the computer every single day with e-mail and everything else. Itês not that big of a deal. But for individuals that may not be as computer-savvy or who have less access, you then need to go from going on the computer from once a day, or once every couple of days to every day just to fill out this log. That was my only hesitancy there, but I definitely do want to make that as an option though, because itês a lot easier for me to store, track, and collect the information. Because hard copies of anything is always a big pain in the butt, dealing with the post office and the mail being lost. Like you said that you were just moving so Û there was a paycheck that Û who knows where it is.",7/7/15,A4,76,SUB," Yeah, so that was the only thing I can think of. ",7/7/15,A4,77,INT," Ok, cool.",7/7/15,A4,78,SUB," You could use an app or something, just something to track it daily.",7/7/15,A4,79,INT," Oh yeah. In the ideal situation, yeah, Iêd get a lot of the funding and give everyone _ you know _ iPads or whatever, so youêd have a nice, easy way of filling everything out. That would be the ideal situation, and then you get a free iPad as well.",7/7/15,A4,80,SUB, That would be great.,7/7/15,A4,81,INT, All right. Iêll be sure to take note of that so when Iêm asking for more money I can tell them that people are requesting for iPads so I need an extra couple thousand dollars.,7/7/15,A4,82,SUB, There you go.,7/7/15,A4,83,INT," All right, great. Thanks again for your participation and helping me out with the study. And just shoot me a text, or give me a call, if you havenêt gotten that last paycheck forwarded to you, and if there is any sort of problem there Iêve got your new address now and weêll be able to resend out that last check. So you got the one for $10 and the one for $20, itês just the last one for $30 that you still need then, correct?",7/7/15,A4,84,SUB, Correct. Yes.,7/7/15,A4,85,INT," Ok, cool, so you know, just shoot me a text then within like a week or two if it hasnêt come and then Iêll get the paperwork going on that and then Iêll let you know once Duke sends it out, so we can get that all squared away.",7/7/15,A4,86,SUB," All right, sounds good. Thanks.",7/7/15,A4,87,INT," All right, cool (name redacted). Best of luck with your program also. So youêll be doing Û so youêve already done the prelims then or thatês going to be coming up?",7/7/15,A4,88,SUB, Iêm doing it now so I have until September to finish developing the course.,7/7/15,A4,89,INT, Got it. So you have summer and then Û well I guess summer now is almost gone which is crazy.,7/7/15,A4,90,SUB, I know.,7/7/15,A4,91,INT," I always think Iêm going to get a lot of stuff done over the summer and then itês the end of summer and Iêm left scratching my head, wondering what I was doing.",7/7/15,A4,92,SUB, Exactly.,7/7/15,A4,93,INT," But thatês the way things end up going. But all right, cool, thanks again, and just give me a call if you have any questions. Iêll be more than happy to answer them. Otherwise, Iêll probably see you in clinic. Iêll still be hanging around there next year.",7/7/15,A4,94,SUB, All right. Sounds good.,7/7/15,A4,95,INT," All right (name redacted). Thanks again, and hopefully you have a nice, relaxing weekend.",7/7/15,A4,96,SUB, All right. Iêll try. You too.,7/7/15,A4,97,INT, All right. Thanks. Bye.,7/7/15,A4,98,SUB, Bye.,7/7/15,A
