Sub,Line,Speaker,Text,Date88,1,INT," Hi, (name redacted).",10/1/1588,2,SUB, Hi.,10/1/1588,3,INT," Ok, great. So thanks for being able to take care of this tonight. It sounds like the rest of the week is going to be kind of busy. Again, essentially what I want to do is just ask you a couple questions, wrap-up questions to get your thoughts and feelings about the mindfulness class and potential ways in which you feel I might be able to improve it, things that you like, things that you didnêt like. I just have sort of 10 starting questions, and thatês it. The questions are fairly broad. There are no right or wrong answers, just to sort of get your thoughts and your opinions about the mindfulness class. So does that sound good?",10/1/1588,4,SUB," Yes, uh huh.",10/1/1588,5,INT," Ok, great. The very first question then is would you be able to speak to how easy or how difficult it was for you to call in to the weekly mindfulness sessions?",10/1/1588,6,SUB," It was easy because I always called in about five minutes before. I think one time I called 10 Ä you know that it was always five minutes before, and I never had no problems. None at all.",10/1/1588,7,INT," Ok, so in terms of the timing of the call, being in the afternoons, that sort of worked well for your schedule it sounds like?",10/1/1588,8,SUB," Yes, that was better for me because during the day if someone comes around, my friends or children or family members want me to ride someplace, I love riding when somebodyês driving, I will go. I donêt hang out at night. Peopleês so mean now. I want to be home when the sun goes down. So yes, it was better for me.",10/1/1588,9,INT," Ok, great. The second question then is what impact, if any, do you feel the mindfulness program had on your perceptions of chronic pain?",10/1/1588,10,SUB," Now, I stopped focusing on the pain Ä hold on a minute. Hold on. (interruption) I was Ä my daughter was coming in and my alarm was going off. But I stopped focusing on the pain and the one I really loved was the loving kindness practice tips, and I was doing some of that anyway. When I passed people I would speak but I got more into it, asking people –How are you doing today?” or –Have a good day” or –Be safe” and stuff like that. And another one was, I stopped focusing on eating and you had to when you take snacks or when you eat, you know, because I just blew through that. I knew what I need to eat, or what I shouldnêt eat but I just eat all the time. Nothing stopped me from eating. And Ä but focusing on starting from my head and my feet and come up, that was a good one. Iêm trying to think of the name of it.",10/1/1588,11,INT," So you had mentioned the mindful eating one. And then the loving kindness. And you say the one in which you stand up, or Ä oh sorry, from the head to the toes. The body scan exercise.",10/1/1588,12,SUB," Yes. I like that one. And I find that one really works. Also the breathing tips it told me about. I like that one. So after I go through it and have been doing it since then I say it really works, it really helps. It makes you put your mind and focus on something else.",10/1/1588,13,INT, So would you be able to provide me an example perhaps of when or how you were applying one of those mindfulness exercises that you just described when you experienced pain or discomfort?,10/1/1588,14,SUB," Yeah, like the Ä itês not the breathing tip. It might be the breathing where you donêt focus on your hurting. Because when I start hurting, even after chemo, I was focusing on the pain, oh this pain is terrible in my legs and stuff. And then she told us donêt focus on that. You start focusing on something that made you feel good, thinking about someone in your life that made you feel happy or something. And I did. And I started thinking –This too shall pass” or I would start from my head and say –Hm, we went on vacation” or whatever we did. The good things. Try to think of good thoughts. And after I thought about good thoughts about my granddaughters _ I love spending time with my grandchildren _ it wasnêt bad. So if I take my focus off whatês going on and focus on something good, you donêt have time to focus on the pain. It seems like it didnêt last as long, the pain didnêt last as long. And also when I would leave, even if I had appointments or was going to get the chemo or whatever, and I would be nauseated or not feeling well, and I would start passing people, I thought –Now, theyêre older. They look like theyêre in real pain. You always think that your life or your situation is worse than anyone else. But itês not.” So I would get on the elevator with people and especially the ones that would have surgery on their head. I knew they had brain cancer. I would say –Hey, how are you?” And one gentleman, in a wheelchair, he said –Iêm doing good. Itês a good day. Iêm able to look down at the grass and see how green it is. If I was six feet under I couldnêt see that.” I say –You know, that makes sense.” He say –I am able to look up at the sky and see that itês blue. If so, Iêm having a good day.” I say, –You know, I am too.” So every time I would go, even though nobody like going to receive chemo or whatever, I just think Ä I would just always think of him and just think of that part where she said –always” it was loving kindness practice tips. Focus on Ä just say Ä ask people how they doing and have a great day, or if they ask you –Iêm good, Iêm happy, Iêm feeling great today” or just say something positive. And it just made me feel good, and it still does because Ä like sometimes I have like last week I was telling you we were going through a death, last year mom passed. And then I started looking at her pictures and she never gave up. She would always smile and Ä here I go again (voice quivering). Her last day she talked to all of her children and grandkids and great-grands, she talked to all us and gave us positive things like –You were raised in the church. You were raised believing in god. You all keep on loving each other.” And my mom sitting here telling us sheês ready to go. Sheês done what god has told her to do. And here I am saying I want to hold on to her, and sheês saying, she told us the hardest thing I have ever had to do was to give up and say bye to my husband and my children and my grandchildren, but I got to go. So when I was looking at her picture and she was smiling I say –Mom, I know you want us to be happy because you would not come back here if you could.” And I started saying –You did it. You battled lymphoma for over 17 years.”",10/1/1588,15,INT, (unintelligible),10/1/1588,16,SUB, Huh?,10/1/1588,17,INT, Thatês a very long battle. For 17 years?,10/1/1588,18,SUB," Yeah. And the doctors told her when she first got it she might live three months. But they called me, I was working at (name of company redacted) as a nurse, and when they told her about it they called me because the doctor said –You need to come home and talk to your mom because weêre telling her she has cancer and she keeps saying •god didnêt tell me that. God doesnêt tell me I got lymphoma or cancer, and Iêm leaning on him.ê” And I told them that was her belief. She has a strong faith in god. And so now Iêm in a better place. I only let that happen to me for maybe two to three days last week, and I said –Mm mm. Mom donêt want this.” So thatês my belief now, even when I go Thursday. Tomorrow. Whatever the CT scans show, and when I see Dr. (name redacted) I canêt do anything about it but Iêm thinking positive. And because whatês going to be is going to be. But like getting back to these classes, I really enjoyed them, like I told you before. The lady that was doing it, it was her voice. It was so soothing. And she had patience. Patience with us. And it was good.",10/1/1588,19,INT," Yeah, so I believe you started the sessions in early November or mid-November and they ended the final week of December. So during that period I know you had a lot going on. Like you started chemo during that time, I believe as well, right, and then still going into the sickle cell clinic. So you had Ä Iêm sure you were experiencing some pain related to the chemotherapy treatments. During that time, would you say, or can you recall if you had any pain that was specifically related to the sickle cell?",10/1/1588,20,SUB," The chemo I was receiving in that large dose made your joints in your legs and your legs hurt real badly because it was made out of tree bark, and they told me before I got it that was one of the side effects. So I couldnêt ever say if it Ä I did have crisis one time, maybe twice because I had to get transfused three times, but twice because my Ä you know, every time my hemoglobin was real low, and I kept getting real weak and I started having crisis then. I know when Iêm having crisis itês mostly in my lower back or sometimes I have problems breathing, get shortness of breath but it didnêt get short enough for me to go get the oxygen from the hospital emergency room or whatever. So I called the sickle cell team and I told them of my symptoms. I said usually I try to fight my crisis at home. Two to three days I drink a lot of water and take ibuprofen and Iêm ok, but I never did get that energy back. They said come on it. Either your hemoglobinês low or somethingês going on and we need to see how badly your crisis is at this time. So I would go and I would get my labs and they would tell me you need to be transfused. Thatês why youêre having a lot of the things youêre having now. ",10/1/1588,21,INT, Like the breathing issues?,10/1/1588,22,SUB," Uh huh. And (name redacted) the nurse practitioner ended up telling me –I know you donêt like taking narcotics and you depend on ibuprofen” but I stopped taking that because my creatinine was up and they thought it was making my creatinine levels go up but no it was the mass that was pressing against my Ä was on my pelvis pressing against the left kidney. She said all this pain in your legs, the chemotherapy makes you have pains too but we think Ä",10/1/1588,23,INT," Yeah, it sounds like maybe itês a combination of the sickle cell pain and the chemo just exacerbating that pain, sending you into a sort of Ä it doesnêt sound like too severe of a crisis but it definitely wasnêt something you were able to manage on your own in your home.",10/1/1588,24,SUB," Right. So I started taking the pain medicine and it helped. But my biggest problem was I should have called them the day it started but I always wait saying itês going to get better, itês going to get better. And it happened Friday I was in my cardiologistês office, and the pain kept getting worse, and the back pain started. I said I know Iêm in crisis now. My back is in pain too.",10/1/1588,25,INT," I actually have a question about this part. Sorry to interrupt you there. So with these feelings that you were getting leading up to the crisis, so you said you started to get the feelings a couple days before the Friday. So you were able to sense that something wasnêt quite right. At this point in time, had you been already applying any of the mindfulness techniques, and the second question or second part is do you feel the mindfulness exercises that you learned had any sort of positive impact on that experience?",10/1/1588,26,SUB," Yes, because they helped me to maintain instead of going crazy and ending up in the emergency room. Like I told you, like I keep going back to the loving kindness, I kept doing that to myself, saying –You know you done great. A lot of doctors and nurses tell you that you donêt look like a person with sickle cell disease. You done a great job all your life caring for yourself. This too shall pass. I know youêre not feeling good now but youêre going to feel good in the next few minutes.” I just kept talking about positive stuff. Then I started that focusing on Ä let me see, what am I going to do tomorrow or next week? Where am I going for vacation? What did we do last year? And it sort of relieved it some. But when I was in that bad pain it did not take it away completely. But when I started doing that in that office, waiting for the cardiologist, it did relieve it some because I was just sitting there moving and rubbing my legs and couldnêt hardly tolerate it and didnêt want my daughter to see it. But after I stopped focusing on it, it did help me some. ",10/1/1588,27,INT, Ok.,10/1/1588,28,SUB," Like I said, Iêm grateful I was able to get in this class because I learned a lot of stuff I was not doing for myself that helped me with my pain and to get through.",10/1/1588,29,INT," Great, so it definitely sounds like you found quite a few things useful from this class. So my question then is there anything that you didnêt find that useful within the class or anything that you would want to have less of?",10/1/1588,30,SUB," The only thing that I didnêt really focus on that much was Ä I think it was telling you about eating or take Ä I canêt remember whether it was 20 minutes to focus on eating, eat very slowly and when you take your time and chew your food slowly you wonêt eat a whole lot. And I said, –No, this is not for me.” I tried it but I start eating but I said –No, this is not enough” when I was finished. Because I eat slow anyway. And I said, –No this isnêt for me.” She was saying it would make you feel fuller too if you take your time and chew slowly. I said –Uh huh, ok.” I tried it but it didnêt make me feel any fuller.",10/1/1588,31,INT, Yeah.,10/1/1588,32,SUB," Like I said, I can eat regardless.",10/1/1588,33,INT," Yeah, itês very hard when you have a big plate in front of you and it smells good and all of that. So did the chemo really affect your eating at all? It sounds like youêve still been doing fairly well then, in terms of consuming calories.",10/1/1588,34,SUB," Mm hm. For a few days Ä like one week I lost I think it was 10 pounds. It did Ä I didnêt feel an effect of it until after the third day, the third or fourth day. And then I didnêt want anything. I would try to make myself eat or drink something and I couldnêt. And I lost the ideal weight that I wanted to get down to, like about 20 or 22 pounds by getting that high dose. ",10/1/1588,35,INT, Wow.,10/1/1588,36,SUB," Yeah because I was nauseated. But what happened there, that one time, maybe three days straight I didnêt take the medicine when I first got started on the chemo. I said –No, itês not going to happen to me. Iêm not going to get nauseated” and I didnêt take it. After I got started vomiting, I lost control of my whole body and everything, I thought about it. So the second dose I said –You know, Iêm going to be on top of this. Iêm going to start taking the nausea medicine and everything they give me to take Ä”",10/1/1588,37,INT," That probably helped out a little bit, right?",10/1/1588,38,SUB," Yeah, they give you medicines for it, all of that. So yeah, after that, I learned you will get nauseated and everything if you donêt do as they ask you to do. So Iêve been on top of it ever since. After they started seeing me, one time I was down 10 pounds or 15 pounds and they were like –Oh, you lost a lot of weight.” And I started falling in love with little ham biscuits. I wanted salty stuff. And I would eat country ham biscuit. And my daughter said –Mama, you donêt need that. You need to do this.” And they told her –anything she can eat, let her eat it.” And after that I got all that weight, they said –Youêre getting dangerous now. Youêre losing too many pounds at one time.” And I started focusing on that. Mm mm. Something else going to happen if you keep losing",10/1/1588,39,INT," Yeah. The whole sort of process is complete roller coaster, ups and downs and everything. So just two final questions related to the mindfulness, so I donêt take too much of your time. I know itês getting late. Youêve already been talking about this as weêve been having our discussion but the question is how easy or how difficult was it for you to practice mindfulness? So to practice the lessons that Julie, the instructor, would instruct you on during that once-a-night class and you applying or trying to do those exercises that following week?",10/1/1588,40,SUB," It was easy for me because you can do it even when youêre around people and they donêt know what youêre doing. Iêm thinking of how to focus or make myself think Iêm someplace else. Happy places, around happy people. And no one knew what I was doing. Like I tried to even Ä I did even turn my family on to it. And my daughters. And I told them when youêre going through, think positive and think of good thoughts and relax. I said you can also do deep breathing. You donêt have to breathe so that people can see you breathing, but do the breathing techniques. Breathe in and out slowly if you get nervous about anything or get mad. You breathe through it. Start counting those breaths and before you say something out of your mouth you shouldnêt say it because you canêt take it back once it comes out.",10/1/1588,41,INT, Yeah. Itês very hard to put the words back.,10/1/1588,42,SUB," And Iêm still doing it. Iêve been thinking about my daddy, worrying about him. Heês 86 and a lot of men canêt tolerate a lot of pain so when Iêm around him I havenêt been able to go a lot because of the chemo but Iêm trying to tell my family have patience with him. You know. Just start working on your patience because I worked on mine. A lot of things that would blow me out of the water or whatever, I donêt allow to do that anymore. I just calm myself, so yes. Iêm still doing it. Itês very helpful.",10/1/1588,43,INT, Mm hm. So youêve still been working on the techniques that you learned in the class and it sounds like youêre also telling your family members about them.,10/1/1588,44,SUB, Yes. And Iêm going to keep on doing them because theyêre good.,10/1/1588,45,INT," Mm hm. Yeah, especially when itês so easy to do sort of just like you said you could be doing these mindfulness exercises and the person right next to you has no idea what youêre doing. So itês kind of easy in that sense that you can practice these exercises or perform these exercises in anyplace at any time, minus say youêre driving a motor vehicle or something then itês probably good to be aware of your surroundings and what youêre working on. Letês see. Is there anything else youêd like me to know about your experience, whether itês something else positive or perhaps something negative? Your thought on how I might be able to improve this, make it better? If you have any type of suggestions.",10/1/1588,46,SUB," I donêt see how you can make it better. The only thing I said, the only one I didnêt Ä it wasnêt that I didnêt like it, Iêm just an overeater, and thatês something I got to fix. But I hope youêd be able to reach out to more sickle cell patients and take them for it because I remember working with them at the hospital when I was nursing. A lot of younger people donêt have patience, donêt relax when theyêre in pain, and I know it hurt. The pain is terrible. But if they can calm themselves and just realize by talking hateful to the nurses and doctors is not going to work. So when you get to that point you feel like youêre not getting what you want at that time when you want it, come down. Just start counting. Just start doing deep breathing. Focus on, you know when I go home Iêm going to do this, or Iêm going to have a good time. Just focus on positive stuff. And it will help because when I thought when you told me about it, meditating, –No, thatês not going to work for me.” But once I got into it, it truly works. It really does. A lot of the other people too, the other participants, were saying the same thing. I canêt say enough good stuff about it.",10/1/1588,47,INT," So actually Iêve got a question for you then. You mentioned that when you were younger or you see younger people that have difficulty, do you think this would be potentially good if Ä or to sort of get your thoughts on this. If I were to have this intervention available to teenagers or during the transition years, going from the pediatric to the adult clinic, do you think that might be a useful context, or do you think it would be kind of difficult for them to open up to the idea of something like this?",10/1/1588,48,SUB," As young as you can get them, get started with them. Thatês where they need it because now a lot of people a lot of doctors or whatever in the sickle cell department will tell you –Oh youêre not going to get strung out on that drug. Youêre not going to get hooked.” And they got in my chart that Iêm (unintelligible). No Iêm not. I know if I start taking something constantly my body will depend on it. And I saw a little child, I think that child was three or maybe three years old, when I was going to get my hair at the shop but I donêt have to do that now. And he told his mother he want his –cocadeen.” I looked at her and said –What did he just say?” He want his codeine. And he said –cocadeen.” So no, as young as you can start it with them, and where they would understand and they would sit long enough to do it, please do. Donêt wait until theyêre teenagers or older than that. I would start as soon as you can so they will learn and know what to do.",10/1/1588,49,INT," Yeah. Great. So thatês one of my next thoughts is how I could apply this intervention for additional age groups because Iêve heard this from quite a few other people as well and it seems like youêre singing the same story here, or singing the same song here, that this would be a very useful or potentially useful for the younger generation that by starting earlier they could have this additional skill set that they can then potentially apply for the rest of their life, it sounds like",10/1/1588,50,SUB, Mm hm. Yeah. ,10/1/1588,51,INT," It might be difficult to sort of convince them but I feel by even having this sort of having this initial step, this part of the study done, I think weêre going to get some really positive results out of it. Maybe that will help sort of sway some opinions, or at least have some people be open to the possibility or the option. I think that was how I sort of outline this with you, correct, that we donêt really know if this is going to have any positive or negative effects but typically something like this doesnêt really hurt you.",10/1/1588,52,SUB, Right. Thatês true.,10/1/1588,53,INT," Yeah. All right. Well you know, I just want to thank you again for being able to call into the weekly sessions and taking the time out to talk with me and call me. I know your life has had a lot of things going on in it but I am definitely incredibly thankful for your participation. Youêve been able to give me a lot of good insights into potential areas that have worked for you and potentially how to move forward. So I guess one last thing. You should have got the paycheck by now. I would have imagined, right?",10/1/1588,54,SUB," No, I havenêt. Mm hm.",10/1/1588,55,INT, Oh. Ok. So you havenêt gotten it.,10/1/1588,56,SUB, No. Uh uh.,10/1/1588,57,INT, So what Iêm going to do is Iêm going to go into the office tomorrow and Iêll speak with the gentleman who handles and processes all of those checks because it was submitted a little more than Ä probably Ä about two and a half or three weeks ago. Normally they take about 10 business days which is two weeks. But Iêll just double-check on that and see whatês going on and Iêll give you a call just to let you know. Or actually I donêt need to call you. Iêll just send you an e-mail since I know I have your e-mail just to sort of let you know what I hear back from them because it should be there. If it didnêt come on Monday or Tuesday hopefully by the end of this week. But just wanted to let you know I havenêt forgotten about that.,10/1/1588,58,SUB," Ok. I havenêt been worried about that. But Iêm going to keep your number _ you might change it _ but Iêm going to keep your number because I would like to know how things are going with it, and whether you were able to get more people to participate or whether you decided to reach out to any younger people.",10/1/1588,59,INT," Yeah, sure. Iêll keep your e-mail and stuff like that, and Iêll send you my personal e-mail. I believe you have my Duke e-mail address. I also have a google e-mail that I use for a lot of other things, and Iêm going to be leaving Duke in the next couple of months and going somewhere else for the rest of my research projects, so still definitely keep in touch and Iêll let you know the results of this study once I have all of those collected and analyze which should hopefully should be in the next two to two and a half months. It would probably be around early to Ä letês see weêre almost halfway done with February, so probably toward the end of March or the beginning of April. So I will definitely let you know how things turn out, but I think the results should be really really positive though.",10/1/1588,60,SUB, Are you coming back to Duke?,10/1/1588,61,INT," Yeah, so Iêm going to be graduating in June I believe it is so Iêm going to be finishing my PhD, defending my dissertation in June. And right now Iêve been applying for other positions so it looks like I might be going up to the NIH, the National Institute of Health in Bethesda. They have an institute called NHLBI, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. And they have a very large sickle cell program there. Theyêre working on bone and stem cell transplants and other future potential cures for sickle cell. So my goal is to work with some of the doctors there, incorporating in the same research study, the mindfulness program, and continue on.",10/1/1588,62,SUB," Well I wish you luck, keep going, but it seems like every time we get good people dealing with sickle cell people, because weêre very hard to deal with are stressful. I can go to my primary care with a problem and they now know what to diagnose it with. Letês call the sickle cell team. So you get referred back to the sickle cell team and they put everything on them to try to find out whatês wrong with us. So like, lord I canêt remember the doctorês name now that left. It seems like every time we get good people thatês concerned about us, they go. They leave Duke. I hope you Ä I know you got big plans and everything but I hope one day you decide to come back and stay at Duke permanently.",10/1/1588,63,INT," Yeah, well donêt worry about me leaving the sickle cell area. Thatês definitely going to be my primary focus as a clinician, researcher. It just becomes a question of where and what institute and the location. Duke would obviously be a great place to land. The NIH, Johnês Hopkins has a really good sickle cell program. University of Pittsburgh. I think in the next five to 10 years thereês been a lot more emphasis on sickle cell, itês been slow going when you look at what was being done in the 80s and the 90s and the early 2000s. Not really too much going on. There was obviously a lot of studies looking hydroxyurea and some other types of medications, and even just vitamins and very basic things, but in the last five to 10 years, letês say since 2005 to 2010, thereês been a lot more emphasis, and thatês in part due to the National Institute of Health putting a lot more initiatives and funding toward not only pain research but pain within sickle cell, so I think there should be some really good things coming up and hopefully Iêll be able to be a part of that.",10/1/1588,64,SUB," Ok, good. Good luck. Iêve enjoyed talking with you, and Iêm glad I had a chance to meet you.",10/1/1588,65,INT, All right (name redacted). Thanks again and if you ever have any questions in the future feel free to give me a call or send me an e-mail and Iêll be more than happy to chat.,10/1/1588,66,SUB, Ok. Thanks a lot.,10/1/1588,67,INT, All right. Thanks again. Bye.,10/1/1588,68,SUB, You have a good night.,10/1/1588,69,INT, All right. Good night.,10/1/15
